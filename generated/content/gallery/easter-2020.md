Easter, 2020. Manhanttan, New York.


The streets of downtown reeked with fear and sorrow.
Those of us holed up in our homes perhaps would have pictured a city once bustling with life and energy turning eerily empty, but alas such was not the case.

The disaster struck hardest on the already down-trodden.

Broadway on a warm Sunday afternoon echoed with the delirious murmurs of the homeless.
Some had their suspicious eyes fixated on the fully-masked strangers dashing through the abandoned alleys, not wishing to spend a split second longer than they have to, others stared into their empty bowls, and seemed almost unable to raise their heads.

My heart thumped walking up to the pigeon-feeding strangers, asking if I could take a picture of them, and my hand shaked with fear and uncertainty when handing her a five-dollar note fresh from my wallet.

Truth be told I've walked past them back-and-forth twice trying to muster enough courage, and I wonder if such would have been a decision to celebrate in the days to come, or simply to blame on a rashful madness taking hold.

I know not then that the same may be said for the decisions soon to be made on the same day, on which I now doubt if over-rationalizing would do us any good.

My destination lied to the north, past this section of uncertainty and desolation.

Darkness had befallen the once sleepless city by the time we kissed each other goodbye, and a mixture of rapture, hope, confusion and fear raced in my mind.

Under the dim street lights a colored lady approached me, begging for sympathy on her unborn child.
I parted with the last bill in my wallet, and asked about her plans with the child.

"You mean her name? It'll be Sophia, after her grandmother." She said.
"Ah, beautiful name, isn't it? It's wisdom in Greek." I murmured.
"Wisdom, you said? Hah, you learn something new everyday!" She coughed lightly, and an expression of joy flew through her wrinkled face.

We bid each other farewell as I merged into the darkness.
On the empty train carts I was left alone to marvel at the eerie coindences in life.
Of all the names in all the world, that of this unborn child had to stir some obscure memories of the past.

The calamity brings out the best and the worst in us.

Perhaps in my wildest dreams I did not see myself wandering the streets of a plague-ridden Manhattan, brown paper bag in one hand and camera in the other, chasing what might soon be deemed foolhardy and futile.

Yet this is what happened.
I am elated and grateful for what we experienced, and chose to keep faith on an uncharted journey, for better or worse.
May it fuels our passion, and may it lasts.


Each would have a starkly different narrative of their stories during the outbreak, and such was mine.
We jot these down to commemorate the most fleeting and delicate traces of thought, and to remind ourselves of such in the trying times ahead.
