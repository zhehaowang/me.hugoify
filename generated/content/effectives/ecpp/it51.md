# Adhere to conventions when writing `new` and `delete`

Implementing an `operator new` requires having the right return value, calling `new handle` when there isn't sufficient memory, and coping with requests for no memory.
You'll also want to avoid the normal form of `new`.

Pseudocode for a non-member new then looks like
```cpp
void * operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc)
{                                      // your operator new might
  using namespace std;                 // take additional params

  if (size == 0) {                     // handle 0-byte requests
    size = 1;                          // by treating them as
  }                                    // 1-byte requests, simple and effective

  while (true) {
    attempt to allocate size bytes;

    if (the allocation was successful)
       return (a pointer to the memory);

    // allocation was unsuccessful; find out what the
    // current new-handling function is:
    // unfortunately, there is no way to get at the new-handling function
    // pointer directly, so you have to call set_new_handler to find out what it
    // is
    // this is no longer the case in C++11: C++11 has get_new_handler
    new_handler globalHandler = set_new_handler(0);
    set_new_handler(globalHandler);
    // in a multi-threaded context, you probably need some form of lock for
    // these two operations

    if (globalHandler) (*globalHandler)();
    else throw std::bad_alloc();
  }
}
```
Now given this infinite loop in conventional `operator new`, Item 49's requirement on `new handler` is clear:
`new handler` needs to make more memory available; install a different new-handler; deinstall the new-handler; throw an exception of or derived from bad_alloc; or fail to return

Member `operator new` is inherited by derived classes.
This may have interesting implications. Consider this code
```cpp
class Base {
public:
  static void * operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc);
  ...
};

class Derived: public Base                // Derived doesn't declare
{ ... };                                  // operator new

Derived *p = new Derived;                 // calls Base::operator new!
```
It's possible that `Base`'s `operator new` is geared towards allocating `sizeof(Base)`, and to avoid allocating an unexpected amount of memory with `Base`'s `operator new`, we could do this
```cpp
void * Base::operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc) {
  if (size != sizeof(Base))               // if size is "wrong,"
     return ::operator new(size);         // have standard operator
                                          // new handle the request

  ...                                     // otherwise handle
                                          // the request here
}
```

If you'd like to control memory allocation for arrays on a per-class basis, you need to implement array new: `operator new[]` as well.

You can't assume inside `operator new[]` the size of each object is `sizeof(Base)`, and you can't assume the number of objects is `requestedSize / sizeof(Base)`. And the size passed to `operator new[]` may ask for more memory than filled with objects, as dynamically allocated arrays may include extra space to store number of elements allocated (Item 16).

For `operator delete`, C++ guarantees it needs to be safe to delete `nullptr` (`NULL` as before 11), and you could honor this guarantee with pseudocode like this
```cpp
void operator delete(void *rawMemory) throw() {
  if (rawMemory == 0) return;            // do nothing if the null
                                         // pointer is being deleted

  deallocate the memory pointed to by rawMemory;
}
```
The member version of this is simple, too, except that you need to check the size of the deleted object, in case a `Base::operator delete` tries to delete an object of `Derived` 
```cpp
class Base {                            // same as before, but now
public:                                 // operator delete is declared

  static void * operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc);
  static void operator delete(void *rawMemory, std::size_t size) throw();
  ...
};
void Base::operator delete(void *rawMemory, std::size_t size) throw()
{
  if (rawMemory == 0) return;           // check for null pointer

  if (size != sizeof(Base)) {           // if size is "wrong,"
     ::operator delete(rawMemory);      // have standard operator
     return;                            // delete handle the request
  }
  deallocate the memory pointed to by rawMemory;
  return;
}
```
Interestingly, the `size_t` C++ pass to `delete` may not be correct, if the object being deleted was derived from a class lacking a virtual dtor (Item 7).

**Takeaways**
* `operator new` should contain an infinite loop trying to allocate memory, should call the `new handler` if it can't satisfy a memory request, and should handle requests for zero bytes. Class-specific versions should handle requests for larger blocks than expected
* `operator delete` should do nothing if passed a pointer that is null. Class-specific versions should handle blocks that are larger than expected


Snippet:
```cpp
// adhere_to_conventions_when_customizing_new_and_delete.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>
#include <new>

// demonstrates global and class-specific new that conforms to the conventional
// behaviors 

// a conformant `operator new` needs to
//  * account for zero-allocation
//  * call new_handler in a loop
//  * throw std::bad_alloc if null handler
// (or calling a conformant one)
void* operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc) {
  std::cout << "custom global operator new\n";

  if (size == 0) {
    size = 1;
  }

  while (true) {
    void* handle = malloc(size);
    if (handle) {
      return handle;
    } else {
      std::new_handler currentHandler = std::get_new_handler(); // since c++11
      if (currentHandler) {
        (*currentHandler)();
      } else {
        throw std::bad_alloc();
      }
    }
  }
}

class Base {
public:
  Base() : d_data(10) {}
  virtual ~Base() = default;

  static void* operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc) {
    std::cout << "Base class operator new\n";

    if (size != sizeof(Base)) {
      std::cout << "Allocation not of sizeof(Base), falling back to default\n";
      return ::operator new(size);
    }

    // in this custom new we don't do anything in addition
    return ::operator new(size);
  }

  void print() const { std::cout << d_data << "\n"; }
private:
  int d_data;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
private:
  char d_char;
};

int main() {
  double *pData = new double;
  delete pData;

  Base* pd = new Derived;
  delete pd;

  Base* pb = new Base;
  delete pb;

  // it would seem without an `operator new[] overload`, the global default is
  // used with no issues
  Base* pds = new Base[4];
  pds[3].print();
  delete[] pds;
  return 0;
}


```
