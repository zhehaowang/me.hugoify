# Avoid hiding inherited names

Name hiding (shadowing) looks like this:
```cpp
int x;                        // global variable
void someFunc() {
  double x;                   // local variable

  std::cin >> x;              // read a new value for local x, hides global x
}
```

Now in an inheritance scenario,
```cpp
class Base {
private:
  int x;

public:
  virtual void mf1() = 0; // simple virtual
  virtual void mf2();     // simple virtual
  void mf3();             // non virtual

  ...
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
  virtual void mf1();
  void mf4();

  ...
};
```
Note that we are talking about names here, that includes names of types (enums, nested classes and typedefs)

Suppose `mf4` is implemented like this
```cpp
void Derived::mf4() {
  ...
  mf2();
  ...
}
```
Compiler figures out what `mf2` refers to, they begin by looking at the local scope (that of `mf4`), then the containing scope, that of `Derived`, then the scope of the base class, and it finds `mf2`, so the search stops (if not, search continues to the namespace(s) containing `Base`, if any, and finally to the global scope).

Now suppose we have this
```cpp
class Base {
private:
  int x;

public:
  virtual void mf1() = 0;
  virtual void mf1(int);

  virtual void mf2();

  void mf3();
  void mf3(double);
  ...
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
  virtual void mf1();
  void mf3();
  void mf4();
  ...
};

Derived d;
int x;

...
d.mf1();                   // fine, calls Derived::mf1
d.mf1(x);                  // error! Derived::mf1 hides Base::mf1

d.mf2();                   // fine, calls Base::mf2

d.mf3();                   // fine, calls Derived::mf3
d.mf3(x);                  // error! Derived::mf3 hides Base::mf3
```
From the perspective of name lookup, `Base::mf1` and `Base::mf3` are no longer inherited by `Derived`.
This applies even though the functions in the base and derived classes take different parameter types, and it also applies regardless of whether the functions are virtual or non-virtual.

The rationale behind this behavior is that it prevents you from accidentally inheriting overloads from distant base classes when you create a new derived class in a library or application framework.
In fact, if you are using public inheritance and you don't inherit the overloads, you are violating the is-a relationship between base and derived classes that Item 32 explains is fundamental to public inheritance.

That being the case, you'll almost always want to override C++'s default hiding of inherited names.
You do it with `using` declarations.
```cpp
class Base {
private:
  int x;

public:
  virtual void mf1() = 0;
  virtual void mf1(int);

  virtual void mf2();

  void mf3();
  void mf3(double);
  ...
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
  using Base::mf1;       // make all things in Base named mf1 and mf3
  using Base::mf3;       // visible (and public) in Derived's scope

  virtual void mf1();
  void mf3();
  void mf4();
  ...
};
```
Now inheritance will work as expected
```cpp
Derived d;
int x;

...

d.mf1();                 // still fine, still calls Derived::mf1
d.mf1(x);                // now okay, calls Base::mf1

d.mf2();                 // still fine, still calls Base::mf2

d.mf3();                 // fine, calls Derived::mf3
d.mf3(x);                // now okay, calls Base::mf3
```
This means if you inherit from a base class with overloaded functions and you want to redefine or override only some of them, you need to include a `using` declaration for each name you'd otherwise be hiding.
If you don't, some of the names you'd like to inherit will be hidden.

It's conceivable that you sometimes won't want to inherit all the functions from your base class.
Under public inheritance, this should never be the case.
Under private inheritance, however, it can make sense.

Suppose `Derived` privately inherits from `Base`, and the only version of `mf1` `Derived` wants to inherit is the one taking no parameters.
`using` declaration won't do the trick here, as `using` makes all inherited functions with a given name visible in the derived class.
This is the case for a different technique: a simple forwarding function.
```cpp
class Base {
public:
  virtual void mf1() = 0;
  virtual void mf1(int);

  ...                                    // as before
};

class Derived: private Base {
public:
  virtual void mf1()                   // forwarding function; implicitly
  { Base::mf1(); }                     // inline (see Item 30)
  ...
};

Derived d;
int x;

d.mf1();                               // fine, calls Derived::mf1
d.mf1(x);                              // error! Base::mf1() is hidden
```

When inheritance is combined with templates, an entirely different form of the "inherited names are hidden" issue arises.

**Takeaways**
* Names in derived classes hide names in base classes. Under public inheritance, this is never desirable
* To make hidden names visible again, employ using declarations or forwarding functions


Snippet:
```cpp
// avoid_hiding_inherited_names.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates overriding and overloading at the same time. Instead of the
// default hiding behavior, say, inheriting all overloads, or some overloads is
// desirable.

// arguably overloading and overriding at the same time is not a good idea

class Base {
public:
  Base() : d_data("base data") {}

  void f() { std::cout << "f (void overload, base)\n"; }

};

public:

                 // as the f defined here
  Derived() : d_data("derived data") {}

  }

};

class ImplementationInheritance : private Base {
public:

  // overload defined in this class. (Note that this request does not make sense

  void f(const std::string& data) {
    std::cout << "f (string overload, private inherited): " << data << "\n";
  }

  void f() {

                // overloads of f()
