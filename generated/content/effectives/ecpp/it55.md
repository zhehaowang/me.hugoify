# Familiarize yourself with Boost

Searching for a collection of high-quality, open source, platform- and compiler-independent libraries? Look to Boost.
Interested in joining a community of ambitious, talented C++ developers working on state-of-the-art library design and implementation? Look to Boost.
Want a glimpse of what C++ might look like in the future? Look to Boost.

Boost as of the time of this book, contains libraries of these categories:
* String and text processing, type-safe `printf`, regular expressions, tokenizing and parsing
* Containers, fixed-sized arrays, variable-sized bitsets, multidimensional arrays
* Function objects and higher order programming, like lambda
* Generic programming, with extensive traits
* TMP, MPL library
* Math and numerics, rational numbers; octonions and quaternions; greatest common divisor and least common multiple computations; and random numbers
* Correctness and testing
* Data structures, like type-safe unions
* Inter-language support, like C++ with python
* Memory, like pool
* Miscellaneous, CRC checking, traversing file system, datetime, etc

Boost does not cover GUI, DB communication, etc

**Takeaways**
* Boost is a community and web site for the development of free, open source, peer-reviewed C++ libraries. Boost plays an influential role in C++ standardization
* Boost offers implementations of many TR1 components, but it also offers many other libraries, too
