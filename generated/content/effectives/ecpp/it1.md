# View C++ as a federation of languages

View C++ as a federation of languages.
The rules within each particular sublanguage tend to be straightforward, however, the rules change as you move from one sublanguage to another.

The primary sublanguages are
* C. Statements, blocks, preprocessor, built-in types, arrays, pointers, etc. C++ often offers superior approaches to the C counterparts
* OO C++. Classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding, etc
* Template C++. The aspect of generic programming in C++
* The STL. Containers, iterators, algorithms, function objects that mesh beautifully.

Don't be surprised when moving from one sublanguage to another, the strategy might switch.
For example, pass built-in C types by value, but pass user defined C++ classes by reference to const are often times more efficient.

**Takeaways**
* Rules for effective C++ programming vary, depending on the part of C++ you are using.
