# Avoid returning handles to object internals

Suppose you are working on a rectangle class represented by its upper left and lower right corners.
To keep a Rectangle object small, you decided to keep the extents of a rectangle in a class pointed to by a member in the Rectangle object.
```cpp
class Point {                      // class for representing points
public:
  Point(int x, int y);
  ...

  void setX(int newVal);
  void setY(int newVal);
  ...
};

struct RectData {                    // Point data for a Rectangle
  Point ulhc;                        // ulhc = " upper left-hand corner"
  Point lrhc;                        // lrhc = " lower right-hand corner"
};

class Rectangle {
  ...

private:
  std::shared_ptr<RectData> pData;   // see Item 13 for info on
};                                   // tr1::shared_ptr
```
Now you want to add functions in Rectangle to expose its points:
```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
  ...
  Point& upperLeft() const { return pData->ulhc; }
  Point& lowerRight() const { return pData->lrhc; }
  ...
};
```
This design is self-contradictory: const member functions (meant for read-only use) exposed internal private data that can be modified by client.
In this case, ulhc and lrhc are effectively public.
Since ulhc and lrhc are stored outside the Rectangle class, const member functions of Rectangle can return references to them. (limitation of bitwise const)

Returning pointers, iterators demonstrates the same problem (breaking encapsulation): they are handles whose modification will affect internal members.

Similarly for private member functions, you should never have a public member function return a pointer to a private member function since if you do the access level of that private member function is practically public.

What about this?
```cpp
class Rectangle {
public:
  ...
  const Point& upperLeft() const { return pData->ulhc; }
  const Point& lowerRight() const { return pData->lrhc; }
  ...
};
```
Now clients cannot modify the returned and read-only is conveyed, but it can lead to dangling references.
What if the referred object disappears? Like this
```cpp
class GUIObject { ... };

const Rectangle                             // returns a rectangle by
  boundingBox(const GUIObject& obj);        // value; see Item 3 for why
                                            // return type is const

GUIObject *pgo;                             // make pgo point to
...                                         // some GUIObject

const Point *pUpperLeft =                   // get a ptr to the upper
  &(boundingBox(*pgo).upperLeft());         // left point of its
                                            // bounding box
```
`boundingBox(*pgo)` returns a temporary object that will be destroyed at the end of the statement.
In turn, pUpperLeft will be dangled at the end of the statement that created it.

This is why returning a reference / iterator / pointer to an internal part of the object is dangerous: what if the reference outlives the object?

This doesn't mean you should never return a handle, sometimes you have to, e.g. `operator[]` of `string` and `vector`.
But such functions are exceptions, not the rule.

**Takeaways**
* Avoid returning handles (references, pointers, or iterators) to object internals. This increases encapsulation, helps const member functions act const, and minimizes the creation of dangling handles.


Snippet:
```cpp
// avoid_returning_handle_to_object_internal.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates undefined behavior of dangling reference caused by temporary
// objects + returning a handle to object internal

class MyClass {
public:
  MyClass(const std::string& data) : d_data(data) {}

  const std::string& data() const { return d_data; }
private:
  std::string d_data;
};

MyClass createMyClass(const std::string& data) {
  return MyClass(data);
}

int main() {
  std::string data("data");
  
  const std::string& rd(createMyClass(data).data());
  // rd will be dangling at this point

  MyClass c(createMyClass(data));
  const std::string& rd1(c.data());
  // rd1 will be fine

  std::cout << rd << " " << rd1 << "\n";
  // clang on osx does not demonstrate noticeable behavior for this UB
  return 0;
}

```
