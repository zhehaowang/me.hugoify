# Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object

Once folks learn passing by reference, some become so relenting with it that they start passing references to things that don't exist.

Consider this
```cpp
class Rational {
public:
  Rational(int numerator = 0,               // see Item 24 for why this
           int denominator = 1);            // ctor isn't declared explicit

  ...

private:
  int n, d;                                 // numerator and denominator

friend
   const Rational&                           // see Item 3 for why the
     operator*(const Rational& lhs,         // return type is const
               const Rational& rhs) {
     Rational result(lhs.n * rhs.n, lhs.d * rhs.d);
     return result;
   }
};
```
Returning a reference to a local stack-allocated object would bring undefined behavior to anyone calling operator\*.

What about a heap allocated version? It won't be undefined behavior, but who's in charge of calling delete?

Imagine it's heap allocated with new instead and this code
```cpp
Rational w, x, y, z;

w = x * y * z;                     // same as operator*(operator*(x, y), z)
```
Here is a guaranteed leak as two objects will be heap allocated, but there is only reference to one of them.

What about an even more exotic approach using static?
```cpp
const Rational& operator*(const Rational& lhs,    // warning! yet more
                          const Rational& rhs)    // bad code!
{
  static Rational result;             // static object to which a
                                      // reference will be returned

  result = ...;                      // multiply lhs by rhs and put the
                                      // product inside result
  return result;
}

// client code
bool operator==(const Rational& lhs,            // an operator==
                const Rational& rhs);           // for Rationals

Rational a, b, c, d;

...
if ((a * b) == (c * d))  {
    do whatever's appropriate when the products are equal;
} else    {
   do whatever's appropriate when they're not;
}

// think of the equality test as
if (operator==(operator*(a, b), operator*(c, d)))
```
Not to mention the potentially undesirable lifetime, thread-safety issue of static, the above code's check will always be true.
The two operator\* calls would be returning reference to the same object, so they are always equal.

The right way to write a function that must return a new object is to have that function return a new object. For Rational's operator\*, that means either the following code or something essentially equivalent:
```cpp
inline const Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs, const Rational& rhs) {
  return Rational(lhs.n * rhs.n, lhs.d * rhs.d);
}
```

It all boils down to this: when deciding between returning a reference and returning an object, your job is to make the choice that offers correct behavior. Let your compiler vendors wrestle with figuring out how to make that choice as inexpensive as possible.

**Takeaways**
* Never return a pointer or reference to a local stack object, a reference to a heap-allocated object, or a pointer or reference to a local static object if there is a chance that more than one such object will be needed. (Item 4 provides an example of a design where returning a reference to a local static is reasonable, at least in single-threaded environments.)
