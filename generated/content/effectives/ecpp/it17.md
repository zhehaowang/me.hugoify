# Store new'ed objects in smart pointers in standalone statements

_This item illustrates the same issue as that of emcpp item 21._

Consider this code
```cpp
processWidget(std::shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget), priority());
// vs
std::shared_ptr<Widget> pw(new Widget);  // store newed object
                                         // in a smart pointer in a
                                         // standalone statement

processWidget(pw, priority());           // this call won't leak

// the first version could leak due to compiler being given freedom to reorder
// 1. new Widget
// 2. std::shared\_ptr ctor
// 3. priority()
// as long as 2 comes after 1.
//
// now if compiler orders it as 1 3 2, and 3 throws, 2 won't get to manage the
// allocated resource from 1, and 1 causes a leak.
// so always prefer the second version.
```

**Takeaways**
* Store newed objects in smart pointers in standalone statements. Failure to do this can lead to subtle resource leaks when exceptions are thrown.
