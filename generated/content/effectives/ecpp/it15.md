# Provide access to raw resources in resource managing classes

In the perfect world you only need to interact with resource-managing objects, but in reality many APIs refer to the managed resource directly.
Say, a raw pointer is wanted but we have a shared\_ptr / unique\_ptr. Both of those would offer explicit conversion (via .get()) and implicit conversion (via operator\* and operator->) to access the raw pointer.

User custom resource management classes often demonstrate similar approaches: explicit and implicit.
For example in this Font resource management class that wraps around an underlying FontHandle.
```cpp
// given C API that works with FontHandle

FontHandle getFont();               // from C APIâ€”params omitted
                                    // for simplicity

void releaseFont(FontHandle fh);    // from the same C API

// we have the following RAII class, and to accommodate other APIs
// working directly with FontHandle, we have the explicit and the
// implicit conversions approach

class Font {                           // RAII class
public:
  explicit Font(FontHandle fh)         // acquire resource;
  : f(fh)                              // use pass-by-value, because the
  {}                                   // C API does

  ~Font() { releaseFont(f); }          // release resource

  // explicit
  FontHandle get() const { return f; } // explicit conversion function
  // downside is explicit calls to get() function is required everywhere
  // FontHandle is expected

  // alternative, implicit approach, note the operator overload!
  operator FontHandle() const { return f; } // implicit conversion function
  // downside is increased chance of error
private:
  FontHandle f;                        // the raw font resource
};

...
Font f1(getFont());

// downside of the explicit approach:
useFontHandle(f1.get());  // get has to be called explicitly

// downside of the implicit approach:
FontHandle f2 = f1;                 // oops! meant to copy a Font
                                    // object, but instead implicitly
                                    // converted f1 into its underlying
                                    // FontHandle, then copied that
// Now the program has a FontHandle being managed by the Font object f1,
// but the FontHandle is also available for direct use as f2.
// That's almost never good. For example, when f1 is destroyed, the font
// will be released, and f2 will dangle.
```
The class's designer chooses whether an implicit or explicit approach is provided.
The guideline is in item 18: make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.

It may occur to you returning the resource being managed in resource management classes is contrary to encapsulation.
This is true, but not as disastrous: RAII classes don't exist to encapsulate something, but rather to ensure a particular action, resource release, takes place.

Well-designed classes hides what clients don't need to see, but makes available those things that clients honestly need to access.

**Takeaways**
* APIs often require access to raw resources, so each RAII class should offer a way to get at the resource it manages.
* Access may be via explicit conversion or implicit conversion. In general, explicit conversion is safer, but implicit conversion is more convenient for clients.


Snippet:
```cpp
// provide_access_to_raw_resources_in_raii_classes.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates explicit and implicit approaches to expose resources
// managed by RAII classes

class FontHandle {};

FontHandle getFontHandle() {
  std::cout << "allocate FontHandle\n";
  return FontHandle();
}

void releaseFontHandle(FontHandle fh) {
  std::cout << "release FontHandle\n";
}

class Font {                           // RAII class
public:
  explicit Font(FontHandle fh)         // acquire resource;
  : f(fh)                              // use pass-by-value, because the
  {}                                   // C API does

  ~Font() { releaseFontHandle(f); }          // release resource

  // explicit
  FontHandle get() const {
    std::cout << "explicit get call!\n";
    return f;\
  }
  // explicit conversion function
  // downside is explicit calls to get() function is required everywhere
  // FontHandle is expected

  // alternative, implicit approach (note the operator overload!)
  operator FontHandle() const {
    std::cout << "implicit conversion!\n";
    return f;
  }
  // implicit conversion function
  // downside is increased chance of error
private:
  FontHandle f;                        // the raw font resource
};

void anotherAPIExpectingFontHandle(FontHandle fh) {}

int main() {
  Font font(getFontHandle());
  
  // implicit:
  anotherAPIExpectingFontHandle(font);

  // explicit:
  anotherAPIExpectingFontHandle(font.get());
  return 0;
}
