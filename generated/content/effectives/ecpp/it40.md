# Use multiple inheritance judiciously

When multiple inheriting, it becomes possible to inherit the same name (e.g. function, typedef, etc) from more than one base class.
This could lead to ambiguity.
```cpp
class BorrowableItem {             // something a library lets you borrow
public:
  void checkOut();                 // check the item out from the library

  ...
};

class ElectronicGadget {
private:
  bool checkOut() const;           // perform self-test, return whether

  ...                              // test succeeds
};

class MP3Player:                   // note MI here
  public BorrowableItem,           // (some libraries loan MP3 players)
  public ElectronicGadget
{ ... };                           // class definition is unimportant
MP3Player mp;

mp.checkOut();                     // ambiguous! which checkOut?
```
Note that in this case, even if only `BorrowableItem`'s `checkOut` is accessible, this call is still ambiguous in that C++ first identifies the best match for the call, and then check its accessibility.
In this case both are equally good matches, so it's ambiguous.
To resolve ambiguity, you could do
```cpp
mp.BorrowableItem::checkOut();              // ah, that checkOut...
```

Multiple inheritance could lead to diamond of doom. Like this
```cpp
class File { ... };
class InputFile: public File { ... };
class OutputFile: public File { ... };
class IOFile: public InputFile,
              public OutputFile
{ ... };
```
Now suppose `File` has a data member `fileName`, how many copies of `fileName` should `IOFile` have?

C++ allows both.
By default it provides the replication.
If that's not what you want, you mut make `File` a virtual base class.
To do that, you have all classes that immediately inherit from it use **virtual inheritance**.
```cpp
class File { ... };
class InputFile: virtual public File { ... };
class OutputFile: virtual public File { ... };
class IOFile: public InputFile,
              public OutputFile
{ ... };
```
The std library contains multiple inheritance just like this one, except classes are class templates, and names are `basic_ios`, `basic_istream`, `basic_ostream` and `basic_iostream`.

From the viewpoint of correct behavior, public inheritance should always be virtual.
But correctness is not the only the perspective, due to internal implementation, virtual inheritance costs.
It costs in other ways too: the rules governing the initialization of virtual base classes are more complicated and less intuitive than are those for non-virtual bases: the responsibility for initializing a virtual base is borne by the most derived class in the hierarchy.

Given the above, the advice on virtual inheritance is simple:
* don't use it unless you need to
* if you must use them, avoid putting data into virtual base classes (in this sense, it's similar with Java / .Net interfaces which are not allowed to contain any data)

Now to demonstrate a case where multiple inheritance can be useful.
```cpp
class IPerson {                            // this class specifies the
public:                                    // interface to be implemented
  virtual ~IPerson();

  virtual std::string name() const = 0;
  virtual std::string birthDate() const = 0;
};

class DatabaseID { ... };                  // used below; details are
                                           // unimportant

class PersonInfo {                         // this class has functions
public:                                    // useful in implementing
  explicit PersonInfo(DatabaseID pid);     // the IPerson interface
  virtual ~PersonInfo();

  virtual const char * theName() const;
  virtual const char * theBirthDate() const;

  virtual const char * valueDelimOpen() const;
  virtual const char * valueDelimClose() const;
  ...
};

class CPerson: public IPerson, private PersonInfo {     // note use of MI
public:
  explicit CPerson(    DatabaseID pid): PersonInfo(pid) {}
  virtual std::string name() const                      // implementations
  { return PersonInfo::theName(); }                     // of the required
                                                        // IPerson member
  virtual std::string birthDate() const                 // functions
  { return PersonInfo::theBirthDate(); }
private:                                                // redefinitions of
  const char * valueDelimOpen() const { return ""; }    // inherited virtual
  const char * valueDelimClose() const { return ""; }   // delimiter
};                                                      // functions
```
The idea is that we want to implement a concrete class that public inherits from `IPerson` interface, and we found another class `PerrsonInfo` that has useful functions to help with implementing this concrete class, but those functions are declared virtual.
To override them we privately inherit from `PersonInfo`.

**Takeaways**
* Multiple inheritance is more complex than single inheritance. It can lead to new ambiguity issues and to the need for virtual inheritance
* Virtual inheritance imposes costs in size, speed, and complexity of initialization and assignment. It's most practical when virtual base classes have no data
* Multiple inheritance does have legitimate uses. One scenario involves combining public inheritance from an Interface class with private inheritance from a class that helps with implementation

Snippet:
```cpp
// multiple_inheritance.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

// demonstrates a case where arguably multiple inheritance is useful: inherit
// an interface from a class, and implementation from another (because we want
// to override its virtual functions)

class IPerson {                            // this class specifies the
public:                                    // interface to be implemented
  virtual ~IPerson() = default;

  virtual std::string name() const = 0;
}; 

class PersonInfo {                         // this class has functions
public:                                    // useful in implementing
                                           // the IPerson interface
  virtual ~PersonInfo() = default;

  virtual const char * theName() const {
    std::cout << valueDelimOpen() << "theName called"
              << valueDelimClose() << "\n";
    return "theName";
  }

  virtual const char * valueDelimOpen() const = 0;;
    // made abstract just for the sake
    // of demonstration

  virtual const char * valueDelimClose() const = 0;
};

class CPerson: public IPerson, private PersonInfo {
  // note use of MI: inherit interface from one class, implementation from
  // another (due to wanting to override some of the latter's virtual functions)
public:
  virtual std::string name() const                      // implementations
  { return PersonInfo::theName(); }                     // of the required
                                                        // IPerson member
                                                        // functions
private:                                                // redefinitions of
  const char * valueDelimOpen() const { return "["; }    // inherited virtual
  const char * valueDelimClose() const { return "]"; }   // delimiter
};                                                       // functions

int main() {
  std::unique_ptr<IPerson> pp = std::make_unique<CPerson>();
  pp->name();
  return 0;
}

```
