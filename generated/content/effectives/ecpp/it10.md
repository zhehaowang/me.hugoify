# Have assignment operators return a reference to \*this

You can chain assignments together, and they are right associative.

```cpp
int x, y, z;

x = y = z = 15;                        // chain of assignments

// becomes

x = (y = (z = 15));
```

The way this is implemented is that assignment returns a reference to its left-hand argument, and that's the convention you should follow when you implement assignment operators for your classes.

This convention applies to all assignment operators, not just the standard =, but also +=, -=.

This is only a convention; code that doesn't follow it will compile.
However, the convention is followed by all the built-in types as well as by all the types in the standard library (e.g., string, vector, complex, std::shared\_ptr, etc.).
Unless you have a good reason for doing things differently, don't.

**Takeaways**
* Have assignment operators return a reference to \*this
