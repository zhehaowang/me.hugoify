# Pay attention to compiler warnings

In C++, it's a good bet the compiler writer konws better about what's going on than you do.

Consider this code
```cpp
class B {
public:
virtual void f() const;
};

class D: public B {
public:
virtual void f();
};
```

While the intention is to redefine `B::f` in `D::f`, what actually happens is `D::f` hides `B::f`.
Some compilers would emit a warning for this.

It's generally best practice to write code that compiles warning free at the highest warning level.

Warnings are compiler implementation dependent, so don't get sloppy in your coding and hope that compilers spot the error for you.

**Takeaways**
* Take compiler warnings seriously, and strive to compile warning-free at the maximum warning level supported by your compilers
* Don't become dependent on compiler warnings, because different compilers warn about different things. Porting to a new compiler may eliminate warning messages you've come to rely on


Snippet:
```cpp
// compiler_warning_unexpected_hiding.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <new>

// demonstrates a case where hiding happens instead of overriding, and compiler
// would emit a warning about it.

class Base {
public:
  virtual ~Base() = default;
  virtual void f() const { std::cout << "Base::f\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  // with -Wall clang warns about this hiding behavior
  virtual void f() { std::cout << "Derived::f\n"; }
};

int main() {
  Base* pd = new Derived();
  pd->f(); // hiding! not override!
  delete pd;
  return 0;
}


```
