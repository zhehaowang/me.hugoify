# Declare non-member functions when type conversions should apply to all parameters

Having classes support implicit conversions is generally a bad idea, but there are exceptions. For example, a numerical Rational class.
Having int and float being able to implicit convert to Rational is not a bad idea.

You may have this
```cpp
class Rational {
public:
  Rational(int numerator = 0,        // ctor is deliberately not explicit;
           int denominator = 1);     // allows implicit int-to-Rational
                                     // conversions

  int numerator() const;             // accessors for numerator and
  int denominator() const;           // denominator â€” see Item 22

private:
  ...
};
```

You know you'd like to support arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc., but how?
Which one to choose among member functions, non-member functions, or non-member functions that are friends?

Say you go with member functions
```cpp
class Rational {
public:
...

const Rational operator*(const Rational& rhs) const;
};
```

This is fine
```cpp
Rational oneEighth(1, 8);
Rational oneHalf(1, 2);

Rational result = oneHalf * oneEighth;            // fine

result = result * oneEighth;                      // fine
```

But if you also want to support doing multiply with an int, this breaks
```cpp
result = oneHalf * 2;                             // fine
result = 2 * oneHalf;                             // error!
// or if you rewrite the two, it becomes more obvious
result = oneHalf.operator*(2);                    // fine, implicit conversion from 2 to Rational
                                                  // doable because Rational ctor is not explicit
result = 2.operator*(oneHalf);                    // error!
```

oneHalf has an operator\*, so it's fine.
int doesn't, so compiler will look for non-member functions that can be called like operator\*(2, oneHalf), i.e. functions that are global, or in namespaces. But in this example, that search also fails.

It turns out that parameters are eligible for implicit conversion only if they are listed in the parameter list.
In terms of member function, \*this is not eligible to become target of implicit conversion, causing the second statement to fail.

So, to support mixed mode operators consistently, one approach is to make operator\* not a member. Like this
```cpp
const Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs,     // now a non-member
                         const Rational& rhs)     // function
{
  return Rational(lhs.numerator() * rhs.numerator(),
                  lhs.denominator() * rhs.denominator());
}

Rational oneFourth(1, 4);
Rational result;

result = oneFourth * 2;                           // fine
result = 2 * oneFourth;                           // hooray, it works!
```

The next question is should operator\* be a friend of Rational?
In this case no, because operator\* can be implemented entirely on Rational's public interface.
Whenever you can avoid friend functions, you should.

This item contains nothing but truth, but not the whole truth.
When Rational is class template instead of a class, there are new things to consider.

**Takeaways**
* If you need type conversions on all parameters to a function (including the one pointed to by the this pointer), the function must be a non-member
