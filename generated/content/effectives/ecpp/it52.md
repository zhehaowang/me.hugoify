# Write `placement delete` if you write `placement new`

Recall that when you call this
```cpp
Widget *pw = new Widget;
```
Two functions are called: one to `operator new` to allocate memory, a second to `Widget`'s default constructor.

If step 1 succeeds but 2 fails, C++ runtime system needs to deallocate the memory from step 1, as `pw` is never assigned.

The runtime system needs to figure out which `operator delete` to call, since there may be many: suppose you have global `new` and `delete`, and also class-specific, non-normal forms of `new` and `delete`. Like
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
  ...
  static void* operator new(std::size_t size,              // non-normal
                            std::ostream& logStream)       // form of new
    throw(std::bad_alloc);

  static void operator delete(void *pMemory                // normal class-
                              std::size_t size) throw();   // specific form
                                                           // of delete
  ...
};
```
When an `operator new` takes extra parameters (other than the mandatory `size_t`), the operator is known as `placement new`.

A particularly useful version of `placement new` is one that takes a pointer specifying where the object should be placed.
Like this.
```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t, void *pMemory) throw();   // "placement
                                                          // new"
```
This version is in std's `<new>`, and it's used inside `vector` to create objects in `vector`'s unused capacity.
The term `placement new` is overridden, when people talk about it, they are usually referring to this particular function.

Now if we go back to check how `Widget`'s `placement new` can be problematic, say we have
```cpp
Widget *pw = new (std::cerr) Widget; // call operator new, passing cerr as
                                     // the ostream; this leaks memory
                                     // if the Widget constructor throws
```
When deleting `pw` due to exception in step 2 (as described above, step 1 is `operator new` and step 2 is ctor), the runtime system looks for an `operator delete` taking the same number and type of extra arguments as `operator new`.

In this case, the runtime system would settle on this, a `placement delete`
```cpp
void operator delete(void *, std::ostream&) throw();
```

But `Widget`'s placement `delete` has a different interface, meaning in this case, no `operator delete` is called if `Widget` throws an exception!

To eliminate this possible leak, `Widget` needs to be like
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
  ...

  static void* operator new(std::size_t size, std::ostream& logStream)
    throw(std::bad_alloc);
  static void operator delete(void *pMemory) throw();

  static void operator delete(void *pMemory, std::ostream& logStream)
    throw();
  ...
};
```
Now if step 2 throws, the 2nd `delete` handles it.
But if no exceptions in step 2 and we get a `delete pw` in client code, this call never calls the placement version, meaning to forestall memory leaks associated with `placement new`, you need to provide both the `placement delete` and the normal version (without providing the normal version, the `placement delete` would hide the global regular version).

And because of hiding, if you want the client to be able to use the normal `operator new` as well as the placement version, you'll need to have both.
```cpp
class Base {
public:
  ...

  static void* operator new(std::size_t size,           // this new hides
                            std::ostream& logStream)    // the normal
    throw(std::bad_alloc);                              // global forms
  ...
};

Base *pb = new Base;                        // error! the normal form of
                                            // operator new is hidden

Base *pb = new (std::cerr) Base;            // fine, calls Base's
                                            // placement new
```
Similarly, `operator new`s in derived classes hide both global and inherited versions of `operator new`.
```cpp
class Derived: public Base {                   // inherits from Base above
public:
  ...

  static void* operator new(std::size_t size)  // redeclares the normal
      throw(std::bad_alloc);                   // form of new
  ...
};
Derived *pd = new (std::clog) Derived;         // error! Base's placement
                                               // new is hidden

Derived *pd = new Derived;                     // fine, calls Derived's
                                               // operator new
```

By default, C++ offers the following forms of `new` at global scope:
```cpp
void* operator new(std::size_t) throw(std::bad_alloc);      // normal new

void* operator new(std::size_t, void*) throw();             // placement new

void* operator new(std::size_t,                             // nothrow new â€”
                   const std::nothrow_t&) throw();          // see Item 49
```

If you declare any `operator new`s in your class, you'll hide all three.
Unless you mean to forbid the clients from using these, make sure to make these available in addition to versions you declare.

For each `operator new` you make available, of course, be sure to offer the corresponding `operator delete`, too.
If you want these functions to behave in the usual way, have your class-specific versions call the global versions.

Like this base class
```cpp
class StandardNewDeleteForms {
public:
  // normal new/delete
  static void* operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc)
  { return ::operator new(size); }
  static void operator delete(void *pMemory) throw()
  { ::operator delete(pMemory); }

  // placement new/delete
  static void* operator new(std::size_t size, void *ptr) throw()
  { return ::operator new(size, ptr); }
  static void operator delete(void *pMemory, void *ptr) throw()
  { return ::operator delete(pMemory, ptr); }

  // nothrow new/delete
  static void* operator new(std::size_t size, const std::nothrow_t& nt) throw()
  { return ::operator new(size, nt); }
  static void operator delete(void *pMemory, const std::nothrow_t&) throw()
  { ::operator delete(pMemory); }
};
```
And a derived class of this can avoid hiding via `using` statements.
```cpp
class Widget: public StandardNewDeleteForms {           // inherit std forms
public:
   using StandardNewDeleteForms::operator new;          // make those
   using StandardNewDeleteForms::operator delete;       // forms visible

   static void* operator new(std::size_t size,          // add a custom
                             std::ostream& logStream)   // placement new
     throw(std::bad_alloc);

   static void operator delete(void *pMemory,           // add the corres-
                               std::ostream& logStream) // ponding place-
     throw();                                           // ment delete
  ...
};
```

**Takeaways**
* When you write a placement version of `operator new`, be sure to write the corresponding placement version of `operator delete`. If you don't, your program may experience subtle, intermittent memory leaks
* When you declare placement versions of `new` and `delete`, be sure not to unintentionally hide the normal versions of those functions
