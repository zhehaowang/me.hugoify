# Copy all parts of an object

Say you don't like compiler's copy implementation and provided your own, compiler, in turn, does not warn you if your impl is only copying a part of the object. (E.g. when new data member gets added)

Similarly, you'll need to update the ctors, other forms of assignment opr (+=, etc).

A particular insidious case can arise through inheritance. E.g.
```cpp
class PriorityCustomer: public Customer {                  // a derived class
public:
   ...
   PriorityCustomer(const PriorityCustomer& rhs);
   PriorityCustomer& operator=(const PriorityCustomer& rhs);
   ...

private:
   int priority;
};

PriorityCustomer::PriorityCustomer(const PriorityCustomer& rhs)
: priority(rhs.priority)
{
  logCall("PriorityCustomer copy constructor");
}

PriorityCustomer&
PriorityCustomer::operator=(const PriorityCustomer& rhs)
{
  logCall("PriorityCustomer copy assignment operator");

  priority = rhs.priority;

  return *this;
}
```
The problem with this is the Customer part of PriorityCustomer will be default ctor'ed in the copy ctor, or in the copy assignment the Customer part is not assigned.

Any time you take it upon yourself to write copying functions for a derived class, you must take care to also copy the base class parts. Like this:
```cpp
PriorityCustomer::PriorityCustomer(const PriorityCustomer& rhs)
:    Customer(rhs),                   // invoke base class copy ctor
  priority(rhs.priority)
{
  logCall("PriorityCustomer copy constructor");
}

PriorityCustomer&
PriorityCustomer::operator=(const PriorityCustomer& rhs)
{
  logCall("PriorityCustomer copy assignment operator");

  Customer::operator=(rhs);           // assign base class parts
  priority = rhs.priority;

  return *this;
}
```

The meaning of copy all parts then becomes:
* copy all local data members and
* invoke the appropriate copying function in all base classes

In practice, the two copying functions will often have similar bodies, and this may tempt you to try to avoid code duplication by having one function call the other.
Your desire to avoid code duplication is laudable, but having one copying function call the other is the wrong way to achieve it.

Instead, if you find that your copy constructor and copy assignment operator have similar code bodies, eliminate the duplication by creating a third member function that both call.
Such a function is typically private and is often named init.
This strategy is a safe, proven way to eliminate code duplication in copy constructors and copy assignment operators.

**Takeaways**
* Copying functions should be sure to copy all of an object's data members and all of its base class parts
* Don't try to implement one of the copying functions in terms of the other (copycon / copy assignment opr). Instead, put common functionality in a third function that both call

Snippet:
```cpp
// copy_all_parts.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates when not specified, the copycon (assignment opr) of a derived class does not
// by default invoke the copycon (assignment opr) of the base

class Parent {
public:
  Parent() : d_x(10) { std::cout << "Parent default ctor\n"; }
  Parent(const Parent& rhs) : d_x(rhs.d_x) { std::cout << "Parent copycon\n"; }
  Parent& operator=(const Parent& rhs) {
    d_x = rhs.d_x;
    std::cout << "Parent assignment opr\n";
    return *this;
  }
  int x() const { return d_x; }
  void setX(int x) { d_x = x; }
private:
  int d_x;
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
  Child() : d_y(5) { std::cout << "Child default ctor\n"; }
  Child(const Child& rhs) : Parent(rhs), d_y(rhs.d_y) { std::cout << "Child copy ctor\n"; }
  Child& operator=(const Child& rhs) {
    std::cout << "Child assignment opr\n";
    
    // remember to call Parent's assignment operator!
    Parent::operator=(rhs);
    
    d_y = rhs.d_y;
    return *this;
  }
private:
  void init() {} // to avoid duplication between assignment opr and copycon,
                 // one could put shared code in a private init()

  int d_y;
};

int main() {
  Child c;
  c.setX(20);
  Child d(c);
  d = c;
  std::cout << d.x() << "\n";
  return 0;
}

```
