# Understand the two meanings of `typename`

These two mean the same thing:
```cpp
template<class T> class Widget;                 // uses "class"
template<typename T> class Widget;              // uses "typename"
```

Suppose that we want to print the 2nd element of an STL compliant container, with a template function looking like this (which won't compile but just for illustration purposes)
```cpp
template<typename C>                            // print 2nd element in
void print2nd(const C& container)               // container;
{                                               // this is not valid C++!
  if (container.size() >= 2) {
     C::const_iterator iter(container.begin()); // get iterator to 1st element
     ++iter;                                    // move iter to 2nd element
     int value = *iter;                         // copy that element to an int
     std::cout << value;                        // print the int
  }
}
```
`iter`'s type `C::const_iterator` depends on the template parameter `C`, they are called dependent names.
`const_iterator` is nested inside a class, making it a nested dependent type name.

Nested dependent names can be difficult for parsing.
Suppose this
```cpp
template<typename C>
void print2nd(const C& container)
{
  C::const_iterator * x;
  ...
}
```
We know that `C::const_iterator` is a type name, but the compiler doesn't.
What if `const_iterator` is a static member of `C`, and `x` is a global variable? Then the above wouldn't be declaring a pointer, but rather a multiplication of two values.

Until `C` is known, there is no way to know whether `C::const_iterator` is a type or not, and when the template `print2nd` is parsed, `C` is not known.
This is resolved with this rule: if the parser encounters a nested dependent name in a template, it assumes the name is not a type name unless you tell it otherwise.

By default, nested dependent names are not types.
This is why the first snippet fails: `C::const_iterator` is not considered a type by the compiler.
We have to tell the compiler it is a type, by putting `typename` right before it:
```cpp
template<typename C>                           // this is valid C++
void print2nd(const C& container) {
  if (container.size() >= 2) {
    typename C::const_iterator iter(container.begin());
    ...
  }
}
```

The rule is simple, any time you refer to a nested dependent name in a template, you must precede it by the word `typename`.
But only do it for nested dependent type names:
```cpp
template<typename C>                   // typename allowed (as is "class")
void f(const C&             container,   // typename not allowed
       typename C::iterator iter);       // typename required
```

There is one exception to the rule, `typename` must not precede nested dependent type names in a list of base classes or as a base class identifier in a member initialization list.
E.g.
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Derived: public Base<T>::Nested { // base class list: typename not
public:                                 // allowed
  explicit Derived(int x)
  : Base<T>::Nested(x)                  // base class identifier in mem
  {                                     // init. list: typename not allowed

    typename Base<T>::Nested temp;      // use of nested dependent type
    ...                                 // name not in a base class list or
  }                                     // as a base class identifier in a
  ...                                   // mem. init. list: typename required
};
```

Another example on `typename`:
```cpp
template<typename IterT>
void workWithIterator(IterT iter) {
  typename std::iterator_traits<IterT>::value_type temp(*iter);
  ...
}
```
This makes a copy of what the iterator points to in `temp`.
Type of `temp` is the same as what `iter` points to. (E.g. if `IterT` is `vector<int>::iterator`, `temp` is of type `int`)

Many programmers `typedef` this entire thing
```cpp
template<typename IterT>
void workWithIterator(IterT iter) {
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits<IterT>::value_type value_type;
  value_type temp(*iter);
  ...
}
```
You may find this `typedef typename` weird, but it follows from the rule of putting `typename` before nested dependent type names.

Finally, it's worth pointing out that compilers differ in enforcing this rule: some accept code where `typename` is required but missing, some accept `typename` being present but not allowed, and some reject `typename` where it's required.
This could cause minor portability headaches.

**Takeaways**
* When declaring template parameters, class and typename are interchangeable
* Use typename to identify nested dependent type names, except in base class lists or as a base class identifier in a member initialization list


Snippet:
```cpp
// two_meanings_of_typename.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

// demonstrates the rule of prepending 'typename' before nested dependent type
// names (except when such names are those of base classes in inheritance, or
// appear in a member initialization list)

int x = 10;

class MyClass {
public:
  class Nested {
  public:
    int d_data;
  };

  void doStuff() const { std::cout << "nested do stuff\n"; }

  Nested d_nested;

  // compiler thought: what if you have this? This would become ambiguous
  //static int Nested;

  static int member;
};

template <typename T>
void templateFunc(const T& t) {
  typename T::Nested n; // 'typename' is required here, nested dependent type
                        // name
  T::member *x;         // compiler may think you have this instead: 'member' is
                        // a static data member, and x is something to multiply
                        // it with. So this is a multiplication whose result is
                        // not used, instead of a pointer declaration.
                        // this generates a compiler warning.
  t.doStuff();
}

template <typename T>
class TemplateBase {
public:
  class Nested {

  };
  T data;
};

template <typename T>
class Derived : public TemplateBase<T>::Nested {
public:
  // in the declaration of derived, you don't need a 'typename' to specify
  // TemplateBase<T>::Nested being a nested dependent type name
  Derived() : TemplateBase<T>::Nested() { std::cout << "derived ctor\n"; }
  // similarly with member initialization list
};

int main() {
  MyClass m;
  templateFunc(m);
