# Model "has-a" or "is-implemented-in-terms-of" through composition

Composition is the relationship between types that arises when objects of one type contain objects of another type.

Example:
```cpp
class Address { ... };             // where someone lives

class PhoneNumber { ... };

class Person {
public:
  ...

private:
  std::string name;               // composed object
  Address address;                // ditto
  PhoneNumber voiceNumber;        // ditto
  PhoneNumber faxNumber;          // ditto
};
```
`Person` objects are composed of `string`, `Address`, and `PhoneNumber` objects.

Composition means either “has-a” or “is-implemented-in-terms-of.” 

Most people have little difficulty differentiating "has-a" and "is-a", but how about differentiating "implemented-in-terms-of" and "is-a"?

Consider you want to implement a `set` (no duplicated elements) based on `std::list`, since you don't want to pay the space cost of a binary search tree of `std::set` (three pointers)

How about having this `set` derive from `std::list`?
```cpp
template<typename T>                       // the wrong way to use list for Set
class Set: public std::list<T> { ... };
```
This may seem fine but something is quite wrong: a `set` is not a `list` as a `list` allow duplicated elements but a `set` does not.

The right way here is to suggest a `set` is implemented in terms of a `list`.
```cpp
template<class T>                   // the right way to use list for Set
class Set {
public:
  bool member(const T& item) const;

  void insert(const T& item);
  void remove(const T& item);

  std::size_t size() const;

private:
  std::list<T> rep;                 // representation for Set data
};

// and the implementation could look like
template<typename T>
bool Set<T>::member(const T& item) const {
  return std::find(rep.begin(), rep.end(), item) != rep.end();
}
template<typename T>
void Set<T>::insert(const T& item) {
  if (!member(item)) rep.push_back(item);
}
template<typename T>
void Set<T>::remove(const T& item) {
  typename std::list<T>::iterator it =               // see Item 42 for info on
    std::find(rep.begin(), rep.end(), item);         // "typename" here
  if (it != rep.end()) rep.erase(it);
}
template<typename T>
std::size_t Set<T>::size() const {
  return rep.size();
}
```
One can argue this `set`'s interface would be easier to use correctly and harder to use incorrectly if it conforms with STL container's interface, but that would require a lot more stuff to the code and better not added for the sake of clarity here.

**Takeaways**
* Composition has meanings completely different from that of public inheritance
* In the application domain, composition means has-a. In the implementation domain, it means is-implemented-in-terms-of
