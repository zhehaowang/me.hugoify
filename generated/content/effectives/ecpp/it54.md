# Familiarize yourself with the standard library, including tr1

The standard for this book was ratified in 1998, and 2003 saw a minor bug-fix update.
C++0x was meant to be a follow-up to 2003.
tr1 heralds the new features in a new release of C++.

Major parts of standard library as specified by C++98:
* STL, containers, iterators, algorithms, function objects and their adapters
* Iostreams
* Support for internationalization (unicode chars, `wstring`, `wchar_t`)
* Support for numeric processing, complex numbers, arrays of pure values (`valarray`)
* An exception hierarchy, `exception`, from which `logic_error`, `runtime_error`, etc derive
* C89's standard library

TR1 of C++98 has:
* `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`
* `function`, to represent any callable entity, e.g. `function<std::string (int)>`
* `bind`
* Hash tables, `unordered_map`, `unordered_multimap`, `unordered_set`, `unordered_multiset`
* Regular expressions
* `tuple`
* `array`, fixed size during compilation, no dynamic memory
* `mem_fun`, adapting member function pointers
* `reference_wrapper`, as if containers hold references
* Random number generation
* Mathematical special functions
* C99 compatibility extensions
And to better support templates, tmp
* Type traits, given `T`, this can reveal if `T` is a built-in type, offers a virtual dtor, is an empty class, is implicitly convertible so some `U`, proper alignment, etc
* `result_of`: deduce the return type of function calls
As pure additions, not to replace anything in standard.

Boost offers these functionality and more, sometimes not the same as specified by the standards.

**Takeaways**
* The primary standard C++ library functionality consists of the STL, iostreams, and locales. The C99 standard library is also included
* TR1 adds support for smart pointers (e.g., `shared_ptr`), generalized function pointers (`function`), hash-based containers, regular expressions, and 10 other components
* TR1 itself is only a specification. To take advantage of TR1, you need an implementation. One source for implementations of TR1 components is Boost
