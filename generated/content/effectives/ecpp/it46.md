# Define non-member functions inside templates when type conversions are desired

Recall that item 24 explained why non-member functions are eligible for implicit type conversions on all arguments (`operator*` on `Rational` class, why it should not be a member function, instead, have a non-member so that `lhs` is eligible for implicit conversion.)

Consider this code, goal is to support the same mixed mode operation item 24 pointed out.
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Rational {
public:
  Rational(const T& numerator = 0,     // see Item 20 for why params
           const T& denominator = 1);  // are now passed by reference

  const T numerator() const;           // see Item 28 for why return
  const T denominator() const;         // values are still passed by value,
  ...                                  // Item 3 for why they're const
};

template<typename T>
const Rational<T> operator*(const Rational<T>& lhs,
                            const Rational<T>& rhs)
{ ... }
```
Now if we have this
```cpp
Rational<int> oneHalf(1, 2);          // this example is from Item 24,
                                      // except Rational is now a template

Rational<int> result = oneHalf * 2;   // error! won't compile
```
The template suggested `lhs` and `rhs` are of the same type, so we can't multiply a `Rational<int>` with a `int`.

Having deduced `lhs` and `T = int`, you might want compilers to use implicit conversion and convert `2` to `Rational<int>` and succeed, but **implicit type conversions are never considered during template argument deduction**.
Such conversions are used during function calls, but before you can call a function, you have to know which functions exist.

This instead will work:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Rational {
public:
  ...

friend                                              // declare operator*
  const Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs,     // function (see
                           const Rational& rhs);    // below for details)
};

template<typename T>                                // define operator*
const Rational<T> operator*(const Rational<T>& lhs, // functions
                            const Rational<T>& rhs)
{ ... }
```
We relieve compilers the work of having to do type deduction, by leveraging the fact that a `friend` declaration in a template class can refer to a specific function. (Class templates don't depend on template argument deduction (that process only applies to function templates)), so `T` is always known at the time the class `Rational<T>` is instantiated.

So what happens here is `oneHalf` will cause `Rational<int>` to be instantiated, when that happens, the `friend` function declaration happens, and as a declared function, compilers no longer need to do type deduction on it, just try to generate code to call it and apply implicit conversion when needed, which in this case will be able to turn `int` into `Rational<int>`.

Note the syntax for declaring the `friend` function, without `<T>` just saves typing, the following is the same.
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Rational {
public:
  ...
friend
   const Rational<T> operator*(const Rational<T>& lhs,
                               const Rational<T>& rhs);
  ...
};
```

Now this will compile but will not link, since compiler knows we want to call `operator*(Rational<int>, Rational<int>)`, that function is declared in `Rational` but not defined there.
We want the template function outside to provide the definition, but things don't work that way: if we declare this `friend` function, we are also responsible for defining it.

The simplest approach is this:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Rational {
public:
  ...

friend const Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs, const Rational& rhs)
{
  return Rational(lhs.numerator() * rhs.numerator(),       // same impl
                  lhs.denominator() * rhs.denominator());  // as in
}                                                          // Item 24
};
```
An interesting observation about this technique is that the use of friendship has nothing to do with needing to access non-public parts of the class.

In order to make type conversions possible on all arguments, we need a non-member function (Item 24 still applies);
And in order to have the proper function automatically instantiated, we need to declare the function inside the class.
The only way to declare a non-member function inside a class is to make it a friend. So that's what we do.

Or you can do this instead with a helper function call, say, you want to avoid the `inline`.
```cpp
template<typename T> class Rational;                 // declare
                                                     // Rational
                                                     // template
template<typename T>                                    // declare
const Rational<T> doMultiply(const Rational<T>& lhs,    // helper
                             const Rational<T>& rhs);   // template
template<typename T>
class Rational {
public:
  ...

friend
  const Rational<T> operator*(const Rational<T>& lhs,
                              const Rational<T>& rhs)   // Have friend
  { return doMultiply(lhs, rhs); }                      // call helper
  ...
};

// doMultiply impl
template<typename T>                                      // define
const Rational<T> doMultiply(const Rational<T>& lhs,      // helper
                             const Rational<T>& rhs)      // template in
{                                                         // header file,
  return Rational<T>(lhs.numerator() * rhs.numerator(),   // if necessary
                     lhs.denominator() * rhs.denominator());
}
```
`doMultiply` does not need to support mixed-mode multiplication, but it doesn't need to.
It will only be called by `operator*`, and `operator*` does support mixed mode.

In essence, `operator*` makes sure implicit conversion happens, and when both become the same `Rational<T>`, `doMultiply` does the action.

**Takeaways**
* When writing a class template that offers functions related to the template that support implicit type conversions on all parameters, define those functions as friends inside the class template


Snippet:
```cpp
// define_non_member_functions_inside_templates_when_type_conversion_desired.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

// demonstrates how to support mixed-mode operations (implicit conversion) (item
// 24) when template classes come into play:
// when writing a class template that offers functions related to the template
// that support implicit type conversions on all parameters, define those
// functions as friends inside the class template

template <typename T>
class Rational {
  public:
    Rational(T p = 1, T q = 1) : d_p(p), d_q(q) {}

    T p() const { return d_p; }
    T q() const { return d_q; }

    friend
    Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs, const Rational& rhs) {
      return Rational(lhs.p() * rhs.p(), lhs.q() * rhs.q());
    }
    // note that the 'friend' here has nothing to do with being able to access
    // private parts of Rational, rather, to make this a non-member function
    // such that (essentially) implicit conversions on 'this' pointer would be
    // considered.
    // And if we declare this friend we have to define it: either do it like
    // this, or have this call a templated version defined outside. (You can't
    // forego the definition here / a call, since the implementation of the
    // templated version outside won't be instantiated automatically)
  private:
    T d_p;
    T d_q;
};

int main() {
  Rational<int> s(1, 2);

  Rational<int> t = s * 2;
  std::cout << t.p() << "/" << t.q() << "\n";

  t = 2 * s;
  std::cout << t.p() << "/" << t.q() << "\n";
  return 0;
}

```
