# Be aware of template meta programming

TMP is the technique that writes template-based C++ programs that execute during compilation.

TMP makes some things easy that would otherwise be hard or impossible.
They also shift the work from runtime to compile time.

Like the example with `advance` from previous item, this is a version where work is done at runtime
```cpp
template<typename IterT, typename DistT>
void advance(IterT& iter, DistT d) {
  if (typeid(typename std::iterator_traits<IterT>::iterator_category) ==
      typeid(std::random_access_iterator_tag)) {
     iter += d;                                     // use iterator arithmetic
  } else {                                          // for random access iters
    if (d >= 0) { while (d--) ++iter; }             // use iterative calls to
    else { while (d++) --iter; }                    // ++ or -- for other
  }                                                 // iterator categories
}
```

Item 47 shows how `traits` can be more efficient, in fact, the `traits` approach is TMP.

If `advance` looks like the above, consider this code
```cpp
std::list<int>::iterator iter;
advance(iter, 10);                          // move iter 10 elements forward;
                                            // won't compile with above impl.
```
This won't compile, as `iter += d` doesn't work on `list`'s bidirectional iterator.
We know the line `iter += d` will never be executed, but compiler doesn't know that, as `typeid` is a runtime check.
The `traits` TMP approach doesn't have the same problem.

Boost's `mpl` offers a higher level TMP syntax, something that looks very different from ordinary C++.

TMP uses recursive template instantiations to realize recursion (loops).

E.g. this TMP factorial
```cpp
template<unsigned n>                 // general case: the value of
struct Factorial {                   // Factorial<n> is n times the value
                                     // of Factorial<n-1>
  enum { value = n * Factorial<n-1>::value };
};

template<>                           // special case: the value of
struct Factorial<0> {                // Factorial<0> is 1
  enum { value = 1 };

};
```
You get the factorial of `n` by referring to `Factorial<n>::value`.
This uses enum hack described in item 2.

Why is TMP worth knowing about, some examples:
* ensuring dimensional unit correctness (like, a variable representing mass cannot be assigned to a variable representing velocity, but can be divided by such)
* optimizing matrix operations. This code
```cpp
typedef SquareMatrix<double, 10000> BigMatrix;
BigMatrix m1, m2, m3, m4, m5;               // create matrices and
...                                         // give them values
BigMatrix result = m1 * m2 * m3 * m4 * m5;  // compute their product
```
The normal way calls for four temporary matrices and independent for loops, using **TMP expression templates** it's possible to avoid temporaries and merge the loops.
* Generating custom design pattern implementations. **policy-based design**, **generative programming**

**Takeaways**
* Template metaprogramming can shift work from runtime to compile-time, thus enabling earlier error detection and higher runtime performance
* TMP can be used to generate custom code based on combinations of policy choices, and it can also be used to avoid generating code inappropriate for particular types

Snippet:
```cpp
// tmp.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates the classic template meta programming example: Factorial

// a recursion based factorial
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}

// a tmp based factorial
template <unsigned int n>
struct factorial_tmp {
    enum { value = n * factorial_tmp<n - 1>::value };
};

template <>
struct factorial_tmp<0> {
    enum { value = 1 };
};

int main() {
    std::cout << factorial(4) << "\n";
    // computed at runtime
    
    std::cout << factorial_tmp<4>::value << "\n";
    // computed at compile time
    return 0;
}


```
