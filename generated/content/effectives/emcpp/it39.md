# Consider void futures for one-shot event communication

Sometimes it's useful for a task to tell a second asynchronously running task that a particular event has occurred, e.g. a synchronization between the two threads.
One obvious choice for this is a condition variable, the reacting task waits on the detecting task. E.g.
```cpp
// detecting task (the one sending out the signal to tell the
// reacting task)
std::condition_variable cv;             // condvar for event

std::mutex m;                           // mutex for use with cv

…                                       // detect event

cv.notify_one();                        // tell reacting task
// if there are multiple to be notified, use notify_all

// reacting task
…                                      // prepare to react

{                                      // open critical section

  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);  // lock mutex

  cv.wait(lk);                         // wait for notify;
                                       // this isn't correct!

  …                                    // react to event
                                       // (m is locked)

}                                      // close crit. section;
                                       // unlock m via lk's dtor

…                                      // continue reacting
                                       // (m now unlocked)

// before callling wait on the condition variable, it must lock
// a mutex through std::unique_lock (part of C++11 API)
```
This code has a code smell (works but doesn't seem quite right): it uses a mutex who are typically present for controlling access to shared data.
In this case there may be no shared data. 
Two other problems:
* If detecting task notifies the condvar before the reacting task waits, the reacting task will hang.
* The wait statement fails to account for spurious wakeups: meaning the code waiting on a condition variable may be awakened even if the condvar wasn't notified.
Proper code deals with this by confirming that the condition being waited for has truly occurred. Like this:
```cpp
cv.wait(lk,
        []{ return whether the event has occurred; });
// this would require that the reacting task be able to determine
// whether the condition it's waiting for is true. The reacting
// task might not be able to tell (it's what it's waiting for in
// the first place)
```

An alternative is a shared boolean flag and busy wait:
```cpp
// detecting task
std::atomic<bool> flag(false);      // shared flag; see
                                    // Item 40 for std::atomic

…                                   // detect event

flag = true;                        // tell reacting task

// reacting task
…                                   // prepare to react

while (!flag);                      // wait for event

…                                   // react to event
```

This approach does not have the drawbacks of the condition variable approach, but it incurs the cost of polling: the task is not truly blocked, an otherwise idle CPU needs to be occupied.

It's then common to combine the condvar and flag-based design (the bool no longer has to be atomic since it's now protected by the mutex):

```cpp
// detecting task
std::condition_variable cv;           // as before
std::mutex m;

bool flag(false);                     // not std::atomic

…                                     // detect event

{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);   // lock m via g's ctor

  flag = true;                        // tell reacting task
                                      // (part 1)

}                                     // unlock m via g's dtor

cv.notify_one();                      // tell reacting task
                                      // (part 2)

// reacting task
…                                      // prepare to react

{                                      // as before
  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);  // as before

  cv.wait(lk, [] { return flag; });    // use lambda to avoid
                                       // spurious wakeups

  …                                    // react to event
                                       // (m is locked)
}

…                                      // continue reacting
                                       // (m now unlocked)
```
This approach avoids busy wait and deals with spurious wakeups.
Yet the code smell remains, because the detecting task communicates with the reacting task in a curious fashion: the flag, mutex, and cv all work participate in achieving this one thing of signalling, and it's not terribly clean.

An alternative is leveraging the communication channel of futures: 
The detecting task has a std::promise object, and the reacting task has a corresponding std::future object, the reacting task calls wait on the future (waiting for the promise to be set) and the detecting task sets the promise when a signal is detected.

Both promise and future templates expect the type of the data to be transmitted, the std::future and std::promise thus both use a void type. E.g.
```cpp
// given
std::promise<void> p;               // promise for
                                    // communications channel
// the detection code
…                                   // detect event

p.set_value();                      // tell reacting task

// the reaction code

…                                   // prepare to react

p.get_future().wait();              // wait on future
                                    // corresponding to p

…                                   // react to event
```
Like the approach using a flag, the design requires no mutex, would work regardless of whether the detecting task sets its std::promise before or after the reacting task waits, and is immune to spurious wakeups.
Like the condition var approach, the wait is truly blocked instead of busy wait.

However things to keep in mind: item 38 explains the std::future and std::promise share a state allocated on the heap, thus we should expect heap allocation and deallocation with this mechanism.

More importantly, a promise can be set only once, the communication between detection task and reacting task is one-off.

One use case is to create a thread in suspended state.
Say you want to configure its affinity and priority (using native\_handle of a std::thread) before running it, you could do
```cpp
std::promise<void> p;

void react();                        // func for reacting task

void detect()                        // func for detecting task
{
  ThreadRAII tr(                          // use RAII object
    std::thread([]
                {                       
                  p.get_future().wait();
                  react();
                }),
    ThreadRAII::DtorAction::join          // risky! (see below)
  );

  …                                       // thread inside tr
                                          // is suspended here

  p.set_value();                          // unsuspend thread
                                          // inside tr
  …
}
```
There is an issue that if before p.set\_value is executed an exception is thrown, set\_value is never executed, the thread will never be fired as it's stuck on wait. (when dtor is called a join is made on the thread making the dtor hang forever)
There are many ways to address this issue.

Instead we give an example of using a shared\_future to have one detecting task fire off multiple reacting tasks.
```cpp
std::promise<void> p;                // as before

void detect()                        // now for multiple
{                                    // reacting tasks

  auto sf = p.get_future().share();  // sf's type is
                                     // std::shared_future<void>

  std::vector<std::thread> vt;              // container for
                                            // reacting threads

  for (int i = 0; i < threadsToRun; ++i) {
    vt.emplace_back([sf]{ sf.wait();        // wait on local
                          react(); });      // copy of sf; see
  }                                         // Item 42 for info
                                            // on emplace_back

  …                                  // ThreadRAII not used, so
                                     // program is terminated if
                                     // this "…" code throws!

  p.set_value();                     // unsuspend all threads

  …

  for (auto& t : vt) {               // make all threads
    t.join();                        // unjoinable; see Item 2
  }                                  // for info on "auto&"
}
```

**Takeaways**
* For simple event communication, condvar-based designs require a superfluous mutex, impose constraints on the relative progress of detecting and reacting tasks, and require reacting tasks to verify that the event has taken place.
* Designs employing a flag avoid those problems, but are based on polling, not blocking.
* A condvar and flag can be used together, but the resulting communications mechanism is somewhat stilted.
* Using std::promises and futures dodges these issues, but the approach uses heap memory for shared states, and it’s limited to one-shot communication.
