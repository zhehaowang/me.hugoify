# Item 15: use `constexpr` whenever possible

Conceptually, `constexpr` indicates a value's not only constant but also it's known during compilation.

`constexpr` objects and functions have different meanings.
`constexpr` objects are `const` and known at compile time.
Values that are known during compile time may be placed in read-only memory.

And of broader applicability is that integral values that are constant and known during compilation can be used in contexts where C++ requires an integral `constexpr`: e.g. array sizes, integral template arguments, enumerator values, alignment specifiers, etc. E.g.

```cpp
int sz;                             // non-constexpr variable

…

constexpr auto arraySize1 = sz;     // error! sz's value not
                                    // known at compilation

std::array<int, sz> data1;          // error! same problem

constexpr auto arraySize2 = 10;     // fine, 10 is a
                                    // compile-time constant

std::array<int, arraySize2> data2;  // fine, arraySize2
                                    // is constexpr

// Note const doesn't offer the same guarantee: const needs not be
// initialized with values known during compilation
// All constexpr objects are const, not all consts are constexpr
const auto arraySize = sz;          // fine, arraySize is
                                    // const copy of sz

std::array<int, arraySize> data;    // error! arraySize's value
                                    // not known at compilation
```

`constexpr` functions produce compile-time constants (computed during compilation) when they are called with compile-time constants.
If they are called with values not known until runtime, they produce runtime values.

In C++11, `constexpr` may contain no more than a single executable statement: a return. (But you can do recursions to get loops and ternary expr to get `if`s).

In C++14, `constexpr` are limited to taking and returning **literal types**, meaning types that can have values determined during compilation.
In C++11, all built-in types except `void` are literal types, and user defined types may be, too, if they have their ctors and some other member functions constexpr. E.g.

```cpp
class Point {
public:
  constexpr Point(double xVal = 0, double yVal = 0) noexcept
  : x(xVal), y(yVal)
  {}

  constexpr double xValue() const noexcept { return x; }
  constexpr double yValue() const noexcept { return y; }

  // these aren't constexpr since in C++11 constexpr are implicitly
  // const, and they return void which isn't a literal type in C++11.
  void setX(double newX) noexcept { x = newX; }
  void setY(double newY) noexcept { y = newY; }

  // in C++14 both these constraints are lifted. You can do.
  // constexpr void setX(double newX) noexcept     // C++14
  // { x = newX; }

  // constexpr void setY(double newY) noexcept     // C++14
  // { y = newY; }
private:
  double x, y;
};

// And it's fine to do the following (evaluated at compile time)
constexpr Point p1(9.4, 27.7);      // fine, "runs" constexpr
                                    // ctor during compilation

constexpr Point p2(28.8, 5.3);      // also fine

constexpr
Point midpoint(const Point& p1, const Point& p2) noexcept
{
  return { (p1.xValue() + p2.xValue()) / 2,    // call constexpr
           (p1.yValue() + p2.yValue()) / 2 };  // member funcs
}

constexpr auto mid = midpoint(p1, p2);     // init constexpr
                                           // object w/result of
                                           // constexpr function

// and with C++14 (setter constexpr) you can do the following
// return reflection of p with respect to the origin (C++14)
constexpr Point reflection(const Point& p) noexcept
{
  Point result;                       // create non-const Point

  result.setX(-p.xValue());           // set its x and y values
  result.setY(-p.yValue());

  return result;                      // return copy of it
}
```

This blurs the line of computation at runtime with at compile time.
The more code is moved to compile time, the faster your program at runtime.
Conversely the slower to compile.

Use `constexpr` whenever possible: both `constexpr` functions and objects can be employed in a wider range of contexts than non-`constexpr` objects and functions.

Keep in mind that `constexpr` is part of the interface: use it if only you are able to commit to it.
If you later decide to remove it (like adding debug IO since they are generally not permitted), you may break an arbitrary amount of client code.

**Takeaways**
* `constexpr` objects are const and are initialized with values known during compilation.
* `constexpr` functions can produce compile-time results when called with arguments whose values are known during compilation.
* `constexpr` objects and functions may be used in a wider range of contexts than non-`constexpr` objects and functions.
* `constexpr` is part of an object’s or function’s interface.


Snippet:
```cpp
// constexpr.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates a user-defined literal type, whose ctor and other member
// functions are constexpr, and user constexpr functions that work with such
// types. This shifts all the work to compile time.

class Point {
public:
  constexpr Point(double xVal = 0, double yVal = 0) noexcept
  : x(xVal), y(yVal) {
    //std::cout << "ctor\n";
    // compile error: non-constexpr function 'operator<<' cannot be used in a
    // constexpr
  }

  constexpr double xValue() const noexcept { return x; }
  constexpr double yValue() const noexcept { return y; }

  // C++14
  constexpr void setX(double newX) noexcept     // C++14
  { x = newX; }

  constexpr void setY(double newY) noexcept     // C++14
  { y = newY; }
private:
  double x, y;
};

  return { (p1.xValue() + p2.xValue()) / 2,    // call constexpr
           (p1.yValue() + p2.yValue()) / 2 };  // member funcs
}

// return reflection of p with respect to the origin (C++14)
constexpr
Point reflection(const Point& p) noexcept
{
  Point result;                       // create non-const Point

  return result;                      // return copy of it

  constexpr Point p2(28.8, 5.3);      // also fine
  constexpr auto mid = reflection(midpoint(p1, p2));     // init constexpr

  std::cout << mid.xValue() << ", " << mid.yValue() << "\n";
  // done at compile time

  return 0;
