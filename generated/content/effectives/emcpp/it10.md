# Item 10: prefer scoped enums to unscoped enums

As a general rule, declaring a name inside curly braces limits the visibility of that name to the scope defined by the braces.
Not so for the enumerators declared in C++98-style enums.

The names of such enumerators belong to the scope containing the enum (definition is leaked into the enclosing scope, thus unscoped enums), and that means that nothing else in that scope may have the same name:

```cpp
// C++03
enum Color { black, white, red };   // black, white, red are
                                    // in same scope as Color

auto white = false;                 // error! white already
                                    // declared in this scope
// C++11
enum class Color { black, white, red };  // black, white, red
                                         // are scoped to Color

auto white = false;              // fine, no other
                                 // "white" in scope

Color c = white;                 // error! no enumerator named
                                 // "white" is in this scope

Color c = Color::white;          // fine

auto c = Color::white;           // also fine (and in accord
                                 // with Item 5's advice)
```

Scoped enums are declared via `enum class`.
They are referred to as enum classes as well.

Enum classes
* Reduce namespace pollution
* Are strongly typed (no implicit conversion to other types, while unscoped enum implicitly convert to integral types)

Enum classes can be forward declared (by default the underlying type for scoped enums in `int`, so the compiler knows the size of a forward declared enum.
You can override the default underlying type).

Unscoped enum can be forward declared only if the underlying type is specified.

```cpp
enum class Status;                 // underlying type is int,

enum class Status: std::uint32_t;  // underlying type for
                                   // Status is std::uint32_t
                                   // (from <cstdint>)


enum Color: std::uint8_t;       // fwd decl for unscoped enum;
                                // underlying type is
                                // std::uint8_t

// Underlying type specifications can also go on an enum’s definition:
enum class Status: std::uint32_t { good = 0,
                                   failed = 1,
                                   incomplete = 100,
                                   corrupt = 200,
                                   audited = 500,
                                   indeterminate = 0xFFFFFFFF
                                 };
```

There is a case where unscoped enums may be useful due to its implicit conversion to integral types, say you have the following.

```cpp
using UserInfo =                 // type alias; see Item 9
  std::tuple<std::string,        // name
             std::string,        // email
             std::size_t> ;      // reputation

// elsewhere you see this
UserInfo uInfo;                  // object of tuple type
…
auto val = std::get<1>(uInfo);   // get value of field 1

// You probably don't want to remember what fields 1, 2, 3 are,
// so you could have this instead
enum UserInfoFields { uiName, uiEmail, uiReputation };

UserInfo uInfo;                        // as before
…

auto val = std::get<uiEmail>(uInfo);   // ah, get value of
                                       // email field

// And the corresponding code with scoped enums is substantially
// more verbose:

enum class UserInfoFields { uiName, uiEmail, uiReputation };

UserInfo uInfo;                        // as before
…

auto val =
  std::get<static_cast<std::size_t>(UserInfoFields::uiEmail)>
    (uInfo);

// You could get rid of some of this verbosity using a function, but
// that function has to be evaluated at compile time, since std::get
// is a template.
template<typename E>                               // C++14
constexpr auto toUType(E enumerator) noexcept
{
  return static_cast<std::underlying_type_t<E>>(enumerator);
}

// And you'd be able to do
auto val = std::get<toUType(UserInfoFields::uiEmail)>(uInfo);
```

**Takeaways**
* C++98-style enums are now known as unscoped enums.
* Enumerators of scoped enums are visible only within the enum. They convert to other types only with a cast.
* Both scoped and unscoped enums support specification of the underlying type. The default underlying type for scoped enums is `int`. Unscoped enums have no default underlying type (implementation-dependent integral type that can represent all enumerator values).
* Scoped enums may always be forward-declared. Unscoped enums may be forward-declared only if their declaration specifies an underlying type.


Snippet:
```cpp
// scoped_enums.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates how unscoped enum names are leaked to the scope containing its
// definition

int main() {
  enum State { good, bad };
  //int good = 2; // compiler error: redefinition
  enum class ScopedState : char { good, good1, bad };
  int good1 = 2;
  //MyList<int> list2;
  return 0;
}

```
