# Item 18: use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive-ownership resource management

It's reasonable to assume that by default `std::unique_ptr` is the same size as raw pointers.
If a raw pointer is small enough and fast enough for you, a `std::unique_ptr` almost certainly is, too.

`std::unique_ptr` embodies exclusive ownership semantics.
A non-null `std::unique_ptr` always owns what it points to.

`std::unqiue_ptr` is move-only. Copy is not allowed.
Moving `std::unique_ptr` transfers ownership from source pointer to destination pointer.

Upon destruction, a non-null `std::unique_ptr` destroys its resource.
By default resource destruction is accomplished by applying `delete` to the raw pointer inside the `std::unique_ptr`, but during construction `std::unique_ptr` objects can be configured to take custom deleters: arbitrary function to invoke when deletion happens.

A common use case for `std::unique_ptr` is as a factory function return type for objects in a hierarchy.
Factory constructs an object on the heap, and hands ownership to the user.

A factory method example with custom deleter:
```cpp
auto delInvmt = [](Investment* pInvestment)       // custom
                {                                 // deleter
                  makeLogEntry(pInvestment);      // (a lambda
                  delete pInvestment;             // expression)
                };
// delete the child object via pointer to parent. Parent must
// have virtual dtor.

template<typename... Ts>                          // revised
std::unique_ptr<Investment, decltype(delInvmt)>   // return type
// can return auto in C++14
makeInvestment(Ts&&... params)
{
  std::unique_ptr<Investment, decltype(delInvmt)> // ptr to be
    pInv(nullptr, delInvmt);                      // returned

  if ( /* a Stock object should be created */ ) {
    pInv.reset(new Stock(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  } else if ( /* a Bond object should be created */ ) {
    pInv.reset(new Bond(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  } else if ( /* a RealEstate object should be created */ ) {
    pInv.reset(new RealEstate(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  }

  return pInv;
}
```

Custom deleters generally cause the size the a `std::unique_ptr` to grow from one word to two.

Stateless function objects (e.g., lambda expressions with no captures) typically incur no size penalty when used as deleters, and this means that when a custom deleter can be implemented as either a function or a captureless lambda expression, the lambda is preferable.

Function object deleters with extensive state can yield `std::unique_ptr` objects of significant size. (because the state would then need to be associated with each instance of the pointer object)

`std::unique_ptr` is often used to implement pimpl idiom.

The existence of `std::unique_ptr` for arrays should be of only intellectual interest to you, because `std::array`, `std::vector`, and `std::string` are virtually always better data structure choices than raw arrays.
About the only situation I can conceive of when a `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` would make sense would be when you're using a C-like API that returns a raw pointer to a heap array that you assume ownership of.

`std::unique_ptr` is the C++11 way to express exclusive ownership, but one of its most attractive features is that it easily and efficiently converts to a `std::shared_ptr`.

This is a key part of why `std::unique_ptr` is so well suited as a factory function return type.
Factory functions canâ€™t know whether callers will want to use exclusive-ownership semantics for the object they return or whether shared ownership (i.e., `std::shared_ptr`) would be more appropriate.
By returning a `std::unique_ptr`, factories provide callers with the most efficient smart pointer, but they don't hinder callers from replacing it with its more flexible sibling.

_How is `bslma::ManagedPtr` in C++03 without move semantics?_

From a rough look, `bslma::ManagedPtr` does support the unnatural `auto_ptr` copycon, which takes in modifiable reference and transfers ownership in a "copy constructor".
However, it also has a ctor taking in `bslmf::MovableRef`, which seems to BDE's backport of move semantics and requires more research.

**Takeaways**
* `std::unique_ptr` is a small, fast, move-only smart pointer for managing resources with exclusive-ownership semantics.
* By default, resource destruction takes place via `delete`, but custom deleters can be specified. Stateful deleters and function pointers as deleters increase the size of `std::unique_ptr` objects.
* Converting a `std::unique_ptr` to a `std::shared_ptr` is easy.


Snippet:
```cpp
// unique_ptr.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates using unique_ptr with custom deleter as a factory method return
// type.

const auto CREATE_TYPE = 1;

class Investment {
public:
  virtual ~Investment() = default;
};

class Stock : public Investment {
public:
  Stock() {
    std::cout << "default ctor Stock\n";
  }
  ~Stock() {
    std::cout << "dtor Stock\n";
  }
};

class Bond : public Investment {
public:
  Bond() {
    std::cout << "default ctor Bond\n";
  }
  ~Bond() {
    std::cout << "dtor Bond\n";
  }
};

class RealEstate : public Investment {
public:
  RealEstate() {
    std::cout << "default ctor RealEstate\n";
  }
  ~RealEstate() {
    std::cout << "dtor RealEstate\n";
  }
};

// Example with variadic template and custom unique_ptr deleter
auto delInvmt = [](Investment* pInvestment)       // custom
                {                                 // deleter
                  std::cout << "custom dtor\n";   // (a lambda
                  delete pInvestment;             // expression)
                };

template<typename... Ts>                          // revised
std::unique_ptr<Investment, decltype(delInvmt)>   // return type
// can return auto in C++14
makeInvestment(Ts&&... params)
{
  std::unique_ptr<Investment, decltype(delInvmt)> // ptr to be
    pInv(nullptr, delInvmt);                      // returned

  if (CREATE_TYPE == 1) {
    pInv.reset(new Stock(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  }
  else if (CREATE_TYPE == 2) {
    pInv.reset(new Bond(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  }
  else {
    pInv.reset(new RealEstate(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
  }

  return pInv;
}


int main() {
  auto investment = makeInvestment();
  return 0;
}
