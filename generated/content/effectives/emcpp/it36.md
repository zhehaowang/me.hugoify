# Specify std::launch::async if asynchronicity is essential

When you std::async something, you are asking it to launch with a launch policy.
There are two defined:
* std::launch::async, means the function has to be run asynchronously (on a different thread)
* std::launch::deferred, means the function may run when get or wait is called on the future returned by std::async. When get or wait is invoked, the function will execute synchronously. If neither is invoked the function will never run.

The default launch policy is neither of the two but the or of them:
```cpp
// these two are the same thing
auto fut1 = std::async(f);                     // run f using
                                               // default launch
                                               // policy

auto fut2 = std::async(std::launch::async |    // run f either
                       std::launch::deferred,  // async or
                       f);                     // deferred
```

Using the default launch policy means if we do this on a thread t
```cpp
auto fut = std::async(f);   // run f using default launch policy
```
It's not possible to predict whether f will run concurrently with t, it's not possible to predict whether f runs on a thread different from the thread invoking get or wait on fut. It may not be possible to predict whether f runs at all.

The default launch policy mixes poorly with the use of thread\_local variables (TLS, thread local storage), because if f reads or writes such, it's not possible to predict which thread's variables will be acccessed.
```cpp
auto fut = std::async(f);        // TLS for f possibly for
                                 // independent thread, but
                                 // possibly for thread
                                 // invoking get or wait on fut
```
It also means loops like this one may run forever
```cpp
using namespace std::literals;        // for C++14 duration
                                      // suffixes; see Item 34

void f()                              // f sleeps for 1 second,
{                                     // then returns
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
}

auto fut = std::async(f);             // run f asynchronously
                                      // (conceptually)

while (fut.wait_for(100ms) !=         // loop until f has
       std::future_status::ready)     // finished running...
{                                     // which may never happen!
  …
}
```
In this case if f runs concurrently with the thread calling std::async (launch policy std::launch::async), there is no problem.
But if f is deferred, the status will never be ready (wait\_for and wait\_until on a task that's deferred yields the value std::future\_status::deferred).

This kind of bug can be hard to catch in unit testing: the scheduler may defer f only if the system is under heavy loads or threatened by oversubscription.

To fix this, we shouldn't enter the loop if the execution of f is deferred.
Like this:
```cpp
auto fut = std::async(f);                  // as above

if (fut.wait_for(0s) ==                    // if task is
    std::future_status::deferred)          // deferred...
{
                        // ...use wait or get on fut
  …                     // to call f synchronously


} else {                // task isn't deferred
  while (fut.wait_for(100ms) !=            // infinite loop not
         std::future_status::ready) {      // possible (assuming
                                           // f finishes)

    …                  // task is neither deferred nor ready,
                       // so do concurrent work until it's ready
  }

  …                    // fut is ready

}
```
Unfortunately there is no API on future object to tell if it's deferred, so we do a wait for 0s instead.

The upshot of these various considerations is that using std::async with the default policy for a task is fine as long as
* the task need not run concurrently with thread calling get or wait
* it doesn't matter which thread's local storage are read or written
* either there's guarantee that get or wait will be called on the future returned by std::async, or it's acceptable that the task may never execute
* code using wait\_for and wait\_until takes the possibility of deferred status into account

If any of the conditions do not hold, you may want to guarantee a truly asynchronous execution:
```cpp
auto fut = std::async(std::launch::async, f);  // launch f
                                               // asynchronously
// or have this generic tool
// C++14
template<typename F, typename... Ts>
inline
auto
reallyAsync(F&& f, Ts&&... params)       // return future
{                                        // for asynchronous
  return std::async(std::launch::async,  // call to f(params...)
                    std::forward<F>(f),
                    std::forward<Ts>(params)...);
}

// use reallyAsync just like async
auto fut = reallyAsync(f);         // run f asynchronously;
                                   // throw if std::async
                                   // would throw

// C++11
template<typename F, typename... Ts>
inline
std::future<typename std::result_of<F(Ts...)>::type>
reallyAsync(F&& f, Ts&&... params)       // return future
{                                        // for asynchronous
  return std::async(std::launch::async,  // call to f(params...)
                    std::forward<F>(f),
                    std::forward<Ts>(params)...);
}
```

**Takeaways**
* The default launch policy for std::async permits both asynchronous and synchronous task execution.
* This flexibility leads to uncertainty when accessing thread\_locals, implies that the task may never execute, and affects program logic for timeout-based wait calls.
* Specify std::launch::async if asynchronous task execution is essential.


Snippet:
```cpp
// specify_launch_async_if_asynchronicity_essential.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <future>

using namespace std::literals;

void doAsyncWork() noexcept {
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
}

int main() {
// A quick look at std::thread and std::async (future)
  //auto fut = std::async(doAsyncWork); // default launch policy, can choose deferred
  //auto fut = std::async(std::launch::deferred, doAsyncWork);  // deferred, the loop never stops
  auto fut = std::async(std::launch::async, doAsyncWork);     // async, works just fine

  while (fut.wait_for(100ms) != std::future_status::ready) {
    std::cout << "waiting\n";
  }
  std::cout << "done\n";
  return 0;

  // to fix this, we could add
  /*
  if (fut.wait_for(0s) == std::future_status::deferred) {
    fut.get();
    ...
  } else {
    while (fut.wait_for(100ms) != std::future_status::ready) {
      std::cout << "waiting\n";
    }
    std::cout << "done\n";
  }
  */
}

```
