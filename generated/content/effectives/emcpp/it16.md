# Item 16: make `const` member functions thread safe

If a member function is made `const`, conceptually it should be safe for multiple threads to call the same method at the same time on the same object.

However, consider the case where a `const` member function modifies a `mutable` member variable (say, `getRoot` of a `Polynomial` class modifies the `rootCache` and `isRootCacheValid`, which are declared `mutable`): a `const` member function is no longer threadsafe.

One could add a `mutex` to the `getRoot` operation. Worth noting that `std::mutex` cannot be copied or moved, by doing so `Polynomial` class loses the ability to be copied or moved. `std::atomic` might be a cheaper solution if all you want is a counter, though know that `std::atomic` are also uncopiable and unmovable.

If you require two or more memory locations to be synchronized (e.g. a `bool isValid` and an `int value`), then `std::atomic` is typically not enough.
If you only require one, they typically are.

If your code is designed for a single threaded environment then this is not a concern.
However such environments are becoming rarer.
The safe bet is that `const` member functions will be subject to concurrent execution, and that's why you should ensure your `const` member functions are threadsafe.

**Takeaways**
* Make `const` member functions threadsafe unless you're certain they'll never be used in a concurrent context.
* Use of `std::atomic` variables may offer better performance than a `mutex`, but theyâ€™re suited for manipulation of only a single variable or memory location.


Snippet:
```cpp
// const_threadsafe.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// demonstrates a case where a const member function is only made threadsafe by
// introducing a mutex. The particular example does not involve a multi-threaded
// environment.

// Does const member function mean it's threadsafe?
// No, they could be operating on 'mutable' states.
//
// Should you make them threadsafe?
// Yes. Unless you are sure this code will run in a single-threaded environment.
// (alternatively, you could document the threadsafety behavior like BDE
// components are required to do)
//
// The mutex in this example guarantees threadsafety.

class Polynomial {
public:
  using RootsType = std::vector<double>;

  RootsType roots() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);     // lock mutex

    if (!rootsAreValid) {            // if cache not valid
      computeRoots();
                                     // compute roots,
                                     // store them in rootVals
      rootsAreValid = true;
    }

    return rootVals;
  }

private:
  void computeRoots() const {}

  mutable std::mutex m;
  mutable bool rootsAreValid{ false };    // see Item 7 for info
  mutable RootsType rootVals{};           // on initializers
};

int main() {
  Polynomial p;
  return 0;
}

```
