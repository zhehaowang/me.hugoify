# Item 17: understand special member function generation

Special member functions are those that the compiler will generate on its own.
In C++98 we have four. Default ctor, dtor, copycon, (copy) assignment opr.
They are generated only if they are needed: if you declared ctor with param, the default one won't be generated.
They are implicitly public and inline.
They are not virtual by default, except in a derived class whose parent class's dtor is virtual.

In C++11, two more special member functions are generated, move ctor and move assignment opr.
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
  …
  Widget(Widget&& rhs);              // move constructor

  Widget& operator=(Widget&& rhs);   // move assignment operator
  …
};
```
Both of them perform memberwise move on the non-static members of the class. The move ctor / assignment opr also moves its base class parts (if any).
(Use move on data member / base class that supports it, copy otherwise)

Copycon and copy assignment opr are independent: declare only one and compiler will generate the other one for you.
Movecon and move assignment opr are not: declaring a movecon will cause move assignment opr to not be generated as well, vice versa. Compiler's rationale is that if you need customized movecon, you will want custom move assignment opr as well.

Move operations won't be defined for a class with custom copycon, custom copy assignment opr, or custom dtor: if you need special copy or special dtor, you'll need special move, too.
This goes in the other direction, too. Declaring a movecon or move assignment opr causes compilers to disable copy operations.

To summarize, two moves are generated (when needed) for classes that don't have custom
* copycon or copy assignment
* dtor
* movecon or move assignment

The rule of three: if you have one of custom dtor, copycon, or copy assignment opr, you should have the other two, too.
All standard library classes that manage memory has big three defined.
Default copycon / copy assignment generation is deprecated in C++11 if custom copy assignment / copycon / dtor is present.

C++11 adds "= default" to let you specify the default memberwise approach is desired.
This is often useful in a base class where you need to declare the dtor virtual.
In which case if the default dtor is desirable and you still want the compiler generated moves, you could do the following

```cpp
class Base {
public:
  virtual ~Base() = default;                // make dtor virtual

  Base(Base&&) = default;                   // support moving
  Base& operator=(Base&&) = default;

  Base(const Base&) = default;              // support copying
  Base& operator=(const Base&) = default;

  …

};
```

In fact, it might be a good idea to specify "= default" anyway to clearly state your intention.
Without "= default", consider this case where you decided to add a dtor, the impact is profound as moves are silently deleted.
Say you have a `std::map` in this class, previously it can be moved now it has to be copied, this is orders of magnitude slower.

Default ctor is the same in C++11 as C++98.
Generated dtor is roughly the same, except it's noexcept by default.

If you have template copycon / copy assignment opr, like
```cpp
class Widget {
  …
  template<typename T>                // construct Widget
  Widget(const T& rhs);               // from anything

  template<typename T>                // assign Widget
  Widget& operator=(const T& rhs);    // from anything
  …
};
```

Compiler still generates the defaults (copy, move, etc) for you.

**Takeaway**
* The special member functions are those compilers may generate on their own: default constructor, destructor, copy operations, and move operations.
* Move operations are generated only for classes lacking explicitly declared move operations, copy operations, and a destructor.
* The copy constructor is generated only for classes lacking an explicitly declared copy constructor, and it’s deleted if a move operation is declared. The copy assignment operator is generated only for classes lacking an explicitly declared copy assignment operator, and it’s deleted if a move operation is declared. Generation of the copy operations in classes with an explicitly declared copy operation or destructor is deprecated.
* Member function templates never suppress generation of special member functions.


Snippet:
```cpp
// move_and_special_member_function.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates in a composition, default move con of the whole uses the default
// ctor of the part, if the part has its move con disabled. (Shouldn't the 
// behavior of part be use copy con if no move con in this case though?)

class NoMove {
public:
  NoMove() {
    std::cout << "NoMove default ctor\n";
  };
  
  NoMove(int y) : d_y(y) {
    std::cout << "NoMove ctor taking in y\n";
  };

  ~NoMove() = default;
  
  NoMove(NoMove&&) = delete;
  /*
  {
    std::cout << "NoMove move ctor\n";
  } */

  NoMove& operator=(NoMove&&) = delete;

  NoMove(const NoMove& rhs) : d_y(rhs.d_y) {
    std::cout << "NoMove copycon\n";
  }

  NoMove& operator=(const NoMove& rhs) {
    std::cout << "NoMove copy assignment\n";
    d_y = rhs.d_y;
    return *this;
  }

  void setY(int y) { d_y = y; }
  int y() const { return d_y; }
private:
  int d_y;
};

// Recommended practice is to declare "= default", if the default supplied
// behaviors are desired
// Clearly state your intent

class Base {
public:
  virtual ~Base() = default;                // make dtor virtual

  Base() {
    std::cout << "Base default ctor\n";
  }

  Base(const NoMove& nm) : d_nm(nm) {
    std::cout << "Base ctor taking in NoMove\n";
  }

  // To test out the 'move if possible' behavior on moving an object containing
  // another whose move is deleted.
  // Turns out with default, NoMove default ctor is called again when move
  // happens on Base.
  // With the commented out, NoMove copycon is called as expected.
  Base(Base&& rhs) = default;
  /*
   : x(std::move(rhs.x)),
     d_nm(rhs.d_nm) {
    std::cout << "Base movecon\n";
  }
  */

  Base& operator=(Base&& rhs) {
    std::cout << "Base move assignment opr\n";
    x = std::move(rhs.x);
    return *this;
  }

  Base(const Base&) {
    std::cout << "Base copy con\n";
  }

  Base& operator=(const Base&) = default;

  const NoMove& nm() const { return d_nm; }
private:
  int x;
  NoMove d_nm;
};

int main() {
  // Q1: the std::move shouldn't matter here in the first place, the param is a
  // temporary, and the cast should be no-op. But with / without it the printed
  // result is 0 / 10.
  // Q2: in the version with std::move, and Base's default move con is called,
  // shouldn't the default move con use NoMove's copy con, since NoMove's move
  // con is disabled? In fact it uses NoMove's default ctor.
  // Q3: in the version without std::move, why is Base's movecon not called?
  // A3: presumably optimized away by compiler: this behavior is present with
  // -O0
  Base b(std::move(Base(NoMove(10))));
  //Base b(Base(NoMove(10)));
  std::cout << b.nm().y() << "\n";
  return 0;
}

```
