# Item 19: use `std::shared_ptr` for shared-ownership resource management

An argument for manually manage memory (and dtors) may be the deterministic nature and predictability of when resource reclamation is going to happen.

Why can't we have the best of both worlds:
a system that works automatically (like garbage collection), yet applies to all resources and has predictable timing (like destructors)?
C++11 `std::shared_ptr` does this.

An object accessed via `std::shared_ptr` has its lifetime managed by these shared pointers.
No single one assumes ownership, they collaborate to make sure the object is destroyed when it's no longer needed (last `shared_ptr` stops pointing at the object).

A shared pointer knows how many others are pointing at the object by consulting the resource's reference count.
(Usually ctor increments it (move ctor doesn't), dtor decrements it, copy assignment opr does both.)
When after a decrement the count drops to 0, the `shared_ptr` destroys the object.

As a result
* `std::shared_ptr` is twice the size of unique pointers: it holds a reference to the object and another reference to the reference count of the object.
* Memory for the reference count needs to be dynamically allocated. (Pointed to object has no idea it's managed by a pointer)
* Increments and decrements to reference count needs to be atomic to guarantee threadsafety. Atomic operations are typically slower than the non-atomic counterparts.

Move assignment / ctor is faster than copy assignment / ctor for `std::shared_ptr`, since move doesn't involve atomic increments / decrements but copy does.

Note that if a custom deleter is given it's not part of `shared_ptr`'s type.
This is not the case with `unique_ptr`.
```cpp
auto loggingDel = [](Widget *pw)        // custom deleter
                  {                     // (as in Item 18)
                    makeLogEntry(pw);
                    delete pw;
                  };

std::unique_ptr<                        // deleter type is
  Widget, decltype(loggingDel)          // part of ptr type
  > upw(new Widget, loggingDel);

std::shared_ptr<Widget>                 // deleter type is not
  spw(new Widget, loggingDel);          // part of ptr type
```
The `shared_ptr` deleter design is more flexible.
Having a custom deleter changes the size of the `unique_ptr` (and that deleter is part of `unique_ptr`'s type), while having a custom deleter does not change the size of a `shared_ptr`.

Why the difference? `shared_ptr` stores the deleter not inside each shared pointer object, but together with the reference count, as part of a "control block".

The control block contains reference count, a custom deleter if specified, a custom allocator if specified, and a secondary reference count "the weak count".

The following rules exist for creating control blocks:
* `std::make_shared` always creates a control block
* when a `shared_ptr` is created from `unique_ptr` or `auto_ptr` (and as part of the construction the `unique_ptr` is set to null)
* when a `shared_ptr` is called with a raw pointer
* `shared_ptr` created from `shared_ptr` or `weak_ptr` don't allocate new control blocks. They expect the control block to be passed in.

As a consequence, more than one `shared_ptr`s created from a raw pointer means more than one control blocks thus double free and UB.
Avoid doing this
```cpp
auto pw = new Widget;                          // pw is raw ptr

…

std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1(pw, loggingDel);  // create control
                                               // block for *pw
…

std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw2(pw, loggingDel);  // create 2nd
                                               // control block
                                               // for *pw!
```

Two lessons
* avoid passing raw pointers to `std::shared_ptr`. Use `make_shared` instead.
* if you have to pass a raw pointer to a `shared_ptr`, pass the result directly from new instead.

A particular case to be careful about is `this` pointer.
Say we have the following vector to keep track of processed widgets.
```cpp
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>> processedWidgets;
...
class Widget {
public:
  ...
  void process() {
      processedWidgets.emplace_back(this);    // add it to list of
                                              // processed Widgets;
                                              // this is wrong!
  }
  ...
};
// if there can be other shared pointers to this object, the code is going to UB.
```

You could do instead
```cpp
class Widget: public std::enable_shared_from_this<Widget> {
public:
  ...
  void process() {
    processedWidgets.emplace_back(shared_from_this()); // fine
  }
  ...
};
// Widget derives from std::enable_shared_from_this with Widget itself as a template
// argument. This is completely legal and has a name "Curiously Recurring Template Pattern".
```

`std::enable_shared_from_this` defines a function `shared_from_this()` that allocates control block to the current object without duplicating. Use `shared_from_this()` when you want a `shared_ptr` that points to the same object as `this`.

Underlying `std::enable_shared_from_this` it relies on the current object having a control block, and there must be an existing `shared_ptr` (outside the member function calling `shared_from_this`) pointing to this.
If not, `shared_from_this` typically throws.

To make sure such a `shared_ptr` exists, classes deriving from `std::enable_shared_from_this` typically hides ctor and provides a factory method returning `shared_ptr`. E.g.
```cpp
class Widget: public std::enable_shared_from_this<Widget> {
public:
  // factory function that perfect-forwards args
  // to a private ctor
  template<typename... Ts>
  static std::shared_ptr<Widget> create(Ts&&... params);

  ...
  void process();             // as before
  ...

private:
  …                           // ctors
};
```

Control blocks come at a cost, they may have arbitrarily large deleters, and the underlying impl uses inheritance so there's also vptr (_how?_).

But for the functionality they provide, `shared_ptr`'s cost is very reasonable.
With default deleter and allocator, and created with `make_shared`, the control block is 3 words in size, and its allocation is essentially free. Dereferencing is cheap, atomic operations should map to machine instructions.
If you want to model shared ownership, `shared_ptr` is still the right way to go.

`unique_ptr` cannot be created from `shared_ptr`.

Another thing `shared_ptr` can't do is working with arrays, no array template parameters, unlike `unique_ptr`.
But given different alternatives to built-in array (e.g. `array`, `vector`, `string`), using a smart pointer to manage a dumb array is probably a bad idea in the first place.

**Takeaway**
* `std::shared_ptr`s offer convenience approaching that of garbage collection for the shared lifetime management of arbitrary resources.
* Compared to `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr` objects are typically twice as big, incur overhead for control blocks, and require atomic reference count manipulations.
* Default resource destruction is via delete, but custom deleters are supported. The type of the deleter has no effect on the type of the `std::shared_ptr`.
* Avoid creating `std::shared_ptr`s from variables of raw pointer type.


Snippet:
```cpp
// shared_ptr.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// demonstrates undefined behavior when creating two shared pointers from the
// same raw pointer.
// double free caused by having two control blocks with count 1 but only one
// instance of data, first case by a pointer to this, second case by pointer to
// data.

class Widget : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Widget> {
public:
  void process(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>>& processedWidgets) {
    processedWidgets.emplace_back(this);    // add it to list of
                                            // processed Widgets;
                                            // this is wrong!
  }

  void processCorrect(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>>& processedWidgets) {
    processedWidgets.emplace_back(shared_from_this());
  }
private:
  int d_x;
};

int main() {
  {
    // auto wp = std::make_shared<Widget>();
    // std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>> processedWidgets;
    // wp->process(processedWidgets);
    // wp->process(processedWidgets);
    // double free without shared_from_this
  }

  {
    auto wp = std::make_shared<Widget>();
    // if Widget is not held by a shared_ptr, it'll just throw:
    //   type std::__1::bad_weak_ptr: bad_weak_ptr
    // hence why we typically have a creator function for classes that inherit
    // from shared_from_this, and disable their ctors.
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Widget>> processedWidgets;
    wp->processCorrect(processedWidgets);
    wp->processCorrect(processedWidgets);
    // all good
  }

  {
    auto loggingDel = [](int *pw) {  // custom deleter
      std::cout << "dtor\n";         // (as in Item 18)
      delete pw;
    };

    auto pw = new int(5);
    std::shared_ptr<int> spw1(pw, loggingDel);  // create control
                                                // block for *pw

    std::shared_ptr<int> spw2(pw, loggingDel);  // create 2nd
                                                // control block
                                                // for *pw!
    // double free when freeing spw1 and spw2
  }
  return 0;
}

```
