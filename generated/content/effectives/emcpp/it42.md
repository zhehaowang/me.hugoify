# Consider emplacement instead of insertion

When you have a container holding std::string, it seems logical when you add an element to it you add via insertion functions (insert, push\_front, push\_back, insert\_after), and the type you'd pass in is std::string.

Consider this code though:
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> vs;         // container of std::string

vs.push_back("xyzzy");               // add string literal
```

push\_back is overloaded as following:
```cpp
template <class T,                           // from the C++11
          class Allocator = allocator<T>>    // Standard
class vector {
public:
  …
  void push_back(const T& x);                // insert lvalue
  void push_back(T&& x);                     // insert rvalue
  // why is just having an universal reference version not enough?
  …
};
```
In the call of push\_back with string literal, compiler sees a type mismatch (const char[6] with what vector's instantiated with: std::string), thus what it does becomes the following (create a temporary):
```cpp
vs.push_back(std::string("xyzzy"));  // create temp. std::string
                                     // and pass it to push_back
// here std::string ctor is called, and then the rvalue reference
// is given to push_back to be move ctor'ed to the memory of the
// new object inside std::vector.
// immediately after push_back returns, the temp object is destroyed
// by calling std::string dtor.
```
Here the ctor and dtor of the temporary std::string object is avoidable: as we construct the new std::string object to be held inside the std::vector we could give it the string literal.
And emplace\_back does exactly that.
```cpp
vs.emplace_back("xyzzy");   // construct std::string inside
                            // vs directly from "xyzzy"
// no temporary involved
```
emplace\_back uses perfect forwarding, so it would have the failure / unexpected cases with perfect forwarding:
```cpp
vs.emplace_back(50, 'x');   // insert std::string consisting
                            // of 50 'x' characters
```
Every std container that supports insert supports a corresponding emplace as well.

Insertion functions take objects to be inserted, while emplacement functions take constructor arguments for objects to be inserted.
This difference permits emplacement functions to avoid the creation and destruction of temporary objects that insertion functions can necessitate.

emplacement function can be used even when an insertion function would require no temporary:
```cpp
std::string queenOfDisco("Donna Summer");
// these result in the same
vs.push_back(queenOfDisco);       // copy-construct queenOfDisco
                                  // at end of vs

vs.emplace_back(queenOfDisco);    // ditto
```

Why not always use emplacement then?
Because in current std library, there are scenarios where insertion is faster than emplacement.

Such scenarios are hard to categorize, but emplacement will almost certainly outperform insertion if all the following are true:
* The value being added is constructed into the container, not assigned. Consider this
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> vs;         // as before

…                                    // add elements to vs

vs.emplace(vs.begin(), "xyzzy");     // add "xyzzy" to
                                     // beginning of vs
```
The impl likely uses move assignment underneath, in which case a temporary object will need to be created to serve as the source of move.
Emplacement's edge would then disappear.
node based std containers always use ctor'ed elements instead of assigned, the rest (std::vector, std::string, std::deque, std::array (which is irrelevant)) you can rely on emplace\_back (and emplace\_front as well) to use ctor.
* The argument type(s) being passed differ from the type held by the container.
If they are the same insert would not create the temporary either.
* The container is unlikely to reject the new value as a duplicate.
Reason for this is that in order to detect if a value is already in the container, emplacement typically creates the node with the new value first so that it can compare the value with the rest.

Two other issues worth considering when using emplacement:

Suppose you have a container of std::shared\_ptrs:
```cpp
std::list<std::shared_ptr<Widget>> ptrs;

// say you have a custom deleter
void killWidget(Widget* pWidget);

// and you want to insert shared pointers with a custom deleter
ptrs.push_back(std::shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget, killWidget));
// and it could look like
ptrs.push_back({ new Widget, killWidget });

// note that although recommended, you can't use make_shared here
// since a custom deleter is desired. 
```
With the push\_back approach, a temporary will be created.
Emplacement would avoid creating this temporary, but in this case the temporary is desirable: say during the allocation of the node in the list container an out-of-memory exception is thrown, then as the exception propagates out, the temp object will be freed and being the sole shared pointer referring to Widget object, Widget will be deallocated by calling killWidget.
Nothing leaks.

Now consider the emplacement version
```cpp
ptrs.emplace_back(new Widget, killWidget);

// you'd be calling something like this underneath
std::list::node<std::shared_ptr<Widget>>(new Widget, killWidget);

// think of the above as
template <typename T> 
class Node {
  template <typename... Ps>
  Node<T>(Ps&&... params) :
    something_other_data(xxx),
    T(std::forward<Ps>(params)) {}
  // what if it throws after "new Widget" is constructed, but
  // before T can be done allocated (say, some other member ctor
  // throws an out-of-memory)? As explained below, the new
  // Widget leaks.
};
```
The raw pointer resulting from "new Widget" is perfect forwarded to node ctor and if that ctor throws an exception, as the exception propagates out there is no handle to the heap allocated Widget any more.
It is leaked.

Similarly with std::unique\_ptr with a custom deleter.

Fundamentally, the effectiveness of memory management classes like std::unique\_ptr and std::shared\_ptr is predicated on resources (such as raw pointers from new) being immediately passed to ctors for resource managing objects.
The fact that make\_shared and make\_unique automate this is one of the reasons why they are important.

In cases like this, you need to ensure yourself you are not paying for potentially improved performance with diminished exception safety.

The emplacement / insert versions should then look more like this:
```cpp
// insert version
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw(new Widget,    // create Widget and
                            killWidget);   // have spw manage it

ptrs.push_back(std::move(spw));            // add spw as rvalue

// emplacement version
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw(new Widget, killWidget);
ptrs.emplace_back(std::move(spw));

// in which case emplacement won't outperform insert since spw is
// essentially the temporary now
```

The other case is with explicit ctors.

Say you wrote this by mistake,
```cpp
// using C++11's support for regex
std::vector<std::regex> regexes;

// you wrote this nullptr by mistake
regexes.emplace_back(nullptr);    // add nullptr to container
                                  // of regexes?
                                  // once compiled, this would
                                  // be UB.

// compiler does not reject this, even though
std::regex r = nullptr;           // error! won't compile
// or
regexes.push_back(nullptr);       // error! won't compile
```
This behavior stems from the fact that std::regex can be ctor'ed from character strings (const char \* like)
```cpp
std::regex upperCaseWord("[A-Z]+");
```
And this ctor taking a const char \* is explicit, thus the following
```cpp
std::regex r = nullptr;           // error! won't compile

regexes.push_back(nullptr);       // error! won't compile

std::regex r(nullptr);            // compiles, this is what
                                  // emplacement would
                                  // translate to, calling this
                                  // explicit ctor directly
```

In official terminologies,
```cpp
std::regex r1 = nullptr;         // error! won't compile
// called copy initialization, not eligible to use explicit ctor

std::regex r2(nullptr);          // compiles
// called direct initialization, eligible to use explicit ctor

// and thus
regexes.emplace_back(nullptr);  // compiles. Direct init permits
                                // use of explicit std::regex
                                // ctor taking a pointer

regexes.push_back(nullptr);     // error! copy init forbids
                                // use of that ctor
```
**Takeaways**
* In principle, emplacement functions should sometimes be more efficient than their insertion counterparts, and they should never be less efficient.
* In practice, they're most likely to be faster when (1) the value being added is constructed into the container, not assigned; (2) the argument type(s) passed differ from the type held by the container; and (3) the container won’t reject the value being added due to it being a duplicate.
* Emplacement functions may perform type conversions that would be rejected by insertion functions.


Snippet:
```cpp
// emplacement_instead_of_insertion.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <regex>

using namespace std::literals;

void deleteMyInt(int* ptr) {
  delete ptr;
}

int main() {
  std::vector<std::string> vecString;
  // less efficient
  vecString.push_back("bad stuff");
  // more efficient
  vecString.emplace_back("good stuff");

  std::string str("neutral stuff");
  // equally efficient
  vecString.push_back(str);
  vecString.emplace_back(str);

  std::vector<std::regex> vecRegexes;
  // does not compile, phew
  //vecRegexes.push_back(nullptr);
  // compiles, leads to UB: crashes this program
  //vecRegexes.emplace_back(nullptr);

  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<int>> vecSharePtrInt;
  // more exception safe
  vecSharePtrInt.push_back({new int(3), deleteMyInt});
  // less exception safe
  vecSharePtrInt.emplace_back(new int(3), deleteMyInt);
  return 0;
}

```
