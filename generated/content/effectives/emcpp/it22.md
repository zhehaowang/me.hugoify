# Item 22: when using the pimpl idiom, define special member functions in the implementation file

Pimpl idiom is often used to combat excessive build times.
Why does it help? Consider the following
```cpp
class Widget {                     // in header "widget.h"
public:
  Widget();
  ...
private:
  std::string name;
  std::vector<double> data;
  Gadget g1, g2, g3;               // Gadget is some user-
};                                 // defined type
```
This means the header has to include `vector`, `string`, and `gadget`.
These headers in turn increase the build time of `Widget`'s clients, and if header contents (e.g. `gadget` and `widget`) change, the client has to recompile.
With pimpl you have
```cpp
class Widget {                 // still in header "widget.h"
public:
  Widget();
  ~Widget();                   // dtor is needed—see below
  …

private:
  struct Impl;                 // declare implementation struct
  Impl *pImpl;                 // and pointer to it
};
```
Where `Widget::Impl` is an incomplete type.
There is little you can do an incomplete type, but you can make a pointer to it, given the size is known.
The impl in C++98 then looks something like this:
```cpp
#include "widget.h"            // in impl. file "widget.cpp"
#include "gadget.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Widget::Impl {          // definition of Widget::Impl
  std::string name;            // with data members formerly
  std::vector<double> data;    // in Widget
  Gadget g1, g2, g3;
};

Widget::Widget()               // allocate data members for
: pImpl(new Impl)              // this Widget object
{}

Widget::~Widget()              // destroy data members for
{ delete pImpl; }              // this object
```

With C++11, `unqiue_ptr` is exactly the tool we need, and the code in turn looks something like this
```cpp
#include "widget.h"                 // in "widget.cpp"
#include "gadget.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Widget::Impl {               // as before
  std::string name;
  std::vector<double> data;
  Gadget g1, g2, g3;
};

Widget::Widget()                    // per Item 21, create
: pImpl(std::make_unique<Impl>())   // std::unique_ptr
{}                                  // via std::make_unique
```

However when we use it in a different translation unit, 
```cpp
Widget w;
// Compiler generates: invalid application of 'sizeof' to an incomplete type
// 'Widget::Impl'
```
Problem is that as compiler generates code for `w`'s deletion (delete on the raw pointer inside `unique_ptr`), delete needs to be called on a complete type.
In this translation unit with `pimpl.h` included, struct `Impl` is not a complete type.

So we declare `Widget`'s dtor in the header but not define it.
```cpp
class Widget {                     // as before, in "widget.h"
public:
  Widget();
  ~Widget();                       // declaration only
  …

private:                           // as before
  struct Impl;
  std::unique_ptr<Impl> pImpl;
};

// And
#include "widget.h"                // as before, in "widget.cpp"
#include "gadget.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct Widget::Impl {              // as before, definition of
  std::string name;                // Widget::Impl
  std::vector<double> data;
  Gadget g1, g2, g3;
};

Widget::Widget()                   // as before
: pImpl(std::make_unique<Impl>())
{}

Widget::~Widget()                  // ~Widget definition
{}
// alternative dtor
Widget::~Widget() = default;       // same effect as above
```

Pimpls are often times great candidates for move.
So we add in the move operations.
```cpp
// header
...
  Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept;              // declarations
  Widget& operator=(Widget&& rhs) noexcept;   // only
...

// impl
Widget::Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept = default;              
Widget& Widget::operator=(Widget&& rhs) noexcept = default;

// you can't do "= default" in the header, since that would make it a definition and
// to be able to generate code for the default move (move assignment needs to destroy
// the previously managed item; move ctor needs to be able to delete Impl in case of an
// exception, even though you declare it noexcept), Impl needs to be a complete type
```

And we'll need to write the copy operations ourselves since compiler won't be generate copy operations for classes with move-only types like `unique_ptr`. (Even if they do it'd be a shallow copy of the pointer not a deep copy of the underlying object)

```cpp
// deep copy of an object using pimpl
Widget::Widget(const Widget& rhs)              // copy ctor
: pImpl(nullptr)
{ if (rhs.pImpl) pImpl = std::make_unique<Impl>(*rhs.pImpl); }

Widget& Widget::operator=(const Widget& rhs)   // copy operator=
{
  if (!rhs.pImpl) pImpl.reset();
  else if (!pImpl) pImpl = std::make_unique<Impl>(*rhs.pImpl);
  else *pImpl = *rhs.pImpl;

  return *this;
}
```

Yet if we use a `shared_ptr` for pimpl, the rules of this chapter don't apply.
This would work just fine in client code and the compiler will supply the big five.
```cpp
class Widget {                     // in "widget.h"
public:
  Widget();
  …                                // no declarations for dtor
                                   // or move operations
private:
  struct Impl; 
  std::shared_ptr<Impl> pImpl;     // std::shared_ptr
};                                 // instead of std::unique_ptr
```

The difference between `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` stems from custom deleter support: in `unique_ptr` due to deleter being part of the type (allowing smaller runtime structures and faster runtime code), the type must be complete when using compiler generated dtor or moves.
Such restriction is lifted in `shared_ptr`'s case with deleter not being part of the type.

To use `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` depends on the use case.
It's possible pimpls could desire shared ownership of the underlying.

**Takeaways**
* The pimpl idiom decreases build times by reducing compilation dependencies between class clients and class implementations.
* For `std::unique_ptr` pImpl pointers, declare special member functions in the class header, but implement them in the implementation file. Do this even if the default function implementations are acceptable.
* The above advice applies to `std::unique_ptr`, but not to `std::shared_ptr`.

(_think about it, even though my custom deleter and compiler supplied deleter does the same thing, we still can't use compiler's in `unique_ptr`'s case. Is it because the inline-by-default nature of compiler generated ones?_)

Snippet:
```cpp
// test_driver.m.cpp
#include <pimpl.h>

// demonstrates a case when using unqiue_ptr for pimpl, we need to define dtor
// in the implementation file; shows copy / move impl for pimpl classes using
// unique_ptr

int main() {
  Widget w;
  // The dtor of std::unique_ptr will complain about sizeof or delete to an
  // incomplete type.
  // Problem is that as compiler generates code for w's deletion (delete on the
  // raw pointer inside unique_ptr),
  // delete needs to be called on a complete type. In this translation unit with
  // pimpl.h included, struct Impl
  // is not a complete type.
  w.doStuff();
  return 0;
}
// pimpl.h
#ifndef INCLUDED_PIMPL_H
#define INCLUDED_PIMPL_H

#include <memory>

class Widget {
  public:
    Widget();

    ~Widget();  // this dtor declaration cannot be omitted
    // we declare it here so that we don't run into issues deleting an
    // incomplete type (unique_ptr, whose deleter is part of the type), when
    // using Widget in a different translation unit.

    Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept;              // declarations
    Widget& operator=(Widget&& rhs) noexcept;   // only

    Widget(const Widget& rhs);              // declarations
    Widget& operator=(const Widget& rhs);   // only

    void doStuff() const;
  private:
    struct Impl;
    std::unique_ptr<Impl> p_impl;

}

Widget::Widget() : p_impl(std::make_unique<Widget::Impl>()) {}

Widget::~Widget() = default;
// we still need to define this even if it's using default, here we define it so
// that we don't run into linker errors.

Widget::Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept = default;

Widget::Widget(const Widget& rhs) : p_impl(nullptr) {
  if (rhs.p_impl) {
    p_impl = std::make_unique<Impl>(*rhs.p_impl);
  }
}

Widget&
Widget::operator=(const Widget& rhs)

    p_impl.reset();
  } else if (!p_impl) {
    p_impl = std::make_unique<Impl>(*rhs.p_impl);
  } else {
    *p_impl = *rhs.p_impl;
  }
  
  return *this;
}
