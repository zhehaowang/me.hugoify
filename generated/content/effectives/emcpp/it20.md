# Item 20: use `std::weak_ptr` for `std::shared_ptr` like pointers that can dangle

A `weak_ptr` is like a `shared_ptr` that does not affect an object's reference count.
Thus they face the possibility of the object being destroyed when they try to access it.

A `weak_ptr` cannot be dereferenced directly, nor can they be tested for nullness.
It's because it isn't standalone pointer but rather an augmentation of `shared_ptr`.

The relationship begins at birth. `std::weak_ptr` is typically created from `std::shared_ptr`.
They point to the same place as `std::shared_ptr`, but they don't affect the reference count in the control block.

Weak pointers that dangle are said to have expired.

```cpp
auto spw =                       // after spw is constructed,
  std::make_shared<Widget>();    // the pointed-to Widget's
                                 // ref count (RC) is 1. (See
                                 // Item 21 for info on
                                 // std::make_shared.)
...

std::weak_ptr<Widget> wpw(spw);  // wpw points to same Widget
                                 // as spw. RC remains 1
...
if (wpw.expired()) ...           // if wpw doesn't point
                                 // to an objectâ€¦
```

Often you want to do check if expired, if not, dereference.
But if you do it in two steps, a race condition would be introduced.
Thus you need one atomic operation of check if expired, if not, create a `shared_ptr` from it. This is called lock. Shared pointer ctor taking in a weak pointer is the same operation as lock, just that it throws if the `weak_ptr` has expired.

```cpp
// Form 1 of lock
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw1 = wpw.lock();  // if wpw's expired,
                                            // spw1 is null

auto spw2 = wpw.lock();                     // same as above,
                                            // but uses auto

// Form 2 of lock
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw3(wpw);    // if wpw's expired,
                                      // throw std::bad_weak_ptr
```

How are weak pointers useful?

One case is the following: imagine you have a `loadWidget(id)` call, which by itself is expensive and you want to cache things by `id` inside.

You can't have an unlimited cache.
One way to implement it is use a `weak_ptr` inside: cache the `Widget`s inside with weak pointers, give loaded objects back to the client, let client manage their shared ownership.
When another `load` is called, cache tries locking and if it hasn't expired, cache can just serve the content.
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<const Widget> fastLoadWidget(WidgetID id)
{
  static std::unordered_map<WidgetID,
                            std::weak_ptr<const Widget>> cache;

  auto objPtr = cache[id].lock();   // objPtr is std::shared_ptr
                                    // to cached object (or null
                                    // if object's not in cache)

  if (!objPtr) {                    // if not in cache,
    objPtr = loadWidget(id);        // load it
    cache[id] = objPtr;             // cache it
  }
  return objPtr;
}
```

Another use case is the observer pattern, in which there is subjects (objects whose state may change) and observers (objects to be notified when a state change happens).
Subjects typically hold a pointer to observers, so that they can be notified when a state change happens.
Subjects have no interest in the lifetime of observers, but they care if an observer is destroyed they don't make subsequent access to it.
A reasonable design is to let subjects hold weak pointers to observers.

A third use case is to break cycles in cycling reference by `shared_ptr`.
Instead of A and B holding `shared_ptr`s to each other, A to B could be `shared_ptr` and B to A could be `weak_ptr`.
It's worth noting that this should be a rare case: in a typical parent's lifetime outlives that of its children's use case, parent could hold `unique_ptr` to children and children could hold a raw pointer back to parent if needed.

From an efficiency perspective, `weak_ptr` makes the same case as `shared_ptr`: same size, control block, and operations such as construction, destruction and assignment involves atomic reference count manipulations (of weak count in control block. _Why do we need weak count?_).

**Takeaways**
* Use `std::weak_ptr` for `std::shared_ptr`-like pointers that can dangle.
* Potential use cases for `std::weak_ptr` include caching, observer lists, and the prevention of `std::shared_ptr` cycles.


Snippet:
```cpp
// weak_ptr.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

// demonstrates one use case of weak_ptr in building a cached load operation, in
// which cache uses a weak_ptr that can dangle (to avoid hogging the space if we
// use shared_ptr), and let the client decide the lifetime of the objects
// returned by cache.

class Widget {
public:
  Widget() = default;
  Widget(const Widget&) = default;
  Widget(Widget&&) = default;
  Widget(int id) : d_x(id) {};

  Widget& operator=(const Widget&) = default;
  Widget& operator=(Widget&&) = default;
private:
  int d_x;
};

std::unique_ptr<const Widget> buildWidget(int id) {
  std::cout << "build widget " << id << "\n";
  return std::make_unique<const Widget>(id);
}

std::shared_ptr<const Widget> fastLoadWidget(int id) {
  std::cout << "fast load widget " << id << "\n";
  static std::unordered_map<int,
                            std::weak_ptr<const Widget>> cache;

  auto objPtr = cache[id].lock();   // objPtr is std::shared_ptr
                                    // to cached object (or null
                                    // if object's not in cache)

  if (!objPtr) {                    // if not in cache,
    objPtr = buildWidget(id);       // build it
    cache[id] = objPtr;             // cache it
  }
  return objPtr;
}

int main() {
  std::shared_ptr<const Widget> wp = fastLoadWidget(3);
  auto wp1 = fastLoadWidget(3);
  wp  = nullptr;
  wp1 = nullptr;
  auto wp2 = fastLoadWidget(3);
  return 0;
}
