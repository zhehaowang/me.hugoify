# Item 23: understand `std::move` and `std::forward`

Neither `std::move` nor `std::forward` generates code at runtime.
They are function templates that perform casts.

`std::move` unconditionally casts its argument to an rvalue, while `std::forward` performs this cast only if a particular condition is fulfilled.

`std::move` looks something like this:
```cpp
// C++11
template<typename T>                       // in namespace std
typename remove_reference<T>::type&&
move(T&& param)
{
  using ReturnType =                       // alias declaration;
    typename remove_reference<T>::type&&;  // see Item 9

  return static_cast<ReturnType>(param);
}

// C++14
template<typename T>                          // still in
decltype(auto) move(T&& param)                // namespace std
{
  using ReturnType = remove_reference_t<T>&&;
  return static_cast<ReturnType>(param);
}
```
The `remove_reference` in return type is important since `type&&` is a universal reference (in which case if T is an lvalue reference the universal reference would become an lvalue reference.
To make move truly return a rvalue reference, we have this `remove_reference`.

Point is, `std::move` does rvalue cast, not move.
rvalues are candidates for move, by casting to rvalue reference, it tells compiler the object is eligible to be moved from.

Consider this code,
```cpp
class Annotation {
public:
  explicit Annotation(const std::string text)
  : value(std::move(text))  // "move" text into value; this code
  { ... }                   // doesn't do what it seems to!
  
  ...

private:
  std::string value;
};
```
Is text copied or moved to value?
It is copied due to the fact that the rvalue of const string can't be passed to `std::string`'s move ctor, as move ctors need non-const `std::string`.
However the param of string copy ctor, lvalue-reference-to-const, can bind to a const rvalue.
Thus the string is copied from text to value.

Moral of the story: move doesn't move, and if you want to be able to move from something, don't declare it const.

`std::forward` is a conditional cast. Consider this code
```cpp
void process(const Widget& lvalArg);     // process lvalues
void process(Widget&& rvalArg);          // process rvalues

template<typename T>                     // template that passes
void logAndProcess(T&& param)            // param to process
{
  auto now =                             // get current time
    std::chrono::system_clock::now();

  makeLogEntry("Calling process", now);
  process(std::forward<T>(param));
}

...

Widget w;

logAndProcess(w);                  // call with lvalue
logAndProcess(std::move(w));       // call with rvalue
```
Without the `std::forward`, since param is an lvalue, the overload expecting lvalue will always be called.
To forward the rvalue/lvalue-ness of a parameter, we use std::forward.

`std::forward` casts param into an rvalue, only if param is instantiated with an rvalue. 

Can you replace `std::move` with `std::forward` everywhere?
Technically yes. And neither is really necessary as you can write casts everywhere, just not desirable.
But remember they are different in a mandatory rvalue cast and conditional rvalue cast (that's exactly a forward of the rvalue/lvalue-ness of the object the function param is instantiated with)

**Takeaways**
* `std::move` performs an unconditional cast to an rvalue. In and of itself, it doesnâ€™t move anything.
* `std::forward` casts its argument to an rvalue only if that argument is bound to an rvalue.
* Neither `std::move` nor `std::forward` do anything at runtime.
* Move requests on const objects are treated as copy requests.


Snippet:
```cpp
// move_forward.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// demonstrates perfect forwarding with universal references, and the effect of
// std::move / std::forward

class Widget {};

void process(const Widget& lvalArg) {
    std::cout << "called with lvalue\n";
} // process lvalues

void process(Widget&& rvalArg) {
    std::cout << "called with rvalue\n";
} // process rvalues

template<typename T>                     // template that passes
void logAndProcess(T&& param)            // param to process
{
  process(std::forward<T>(param));   // with forward, the expected version
                                     // (dependent upon what's given to param),
                                     // is called.

  //process(std::move<T>(param));    // with move, the rvalue version will
                                     // always be called even if an lvalue is
                                     // given, if an rvalue is given a compiler
                                     // error is thrown

  //process(param);                  // without forward, the lvalue version will
                                     // always be called
}

int main() {
  Widget w;
  logAndProcess(w);
  logAndProcess(Widget());
  return 0;
}

```
