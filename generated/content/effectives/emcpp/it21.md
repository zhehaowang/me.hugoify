# Item 21: prefer `std::make_unique` and `std::make_shared` to direct use of new

`std::make_unique` is part of C++14.
`std::make_shared` is part of C++11.
If you need to implement it yourself, it looks like this (without supporting arrays)
```cpp
template<typename T, typename... Ts>
std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Ts&&... params)
{
  return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Ts>(params)...));
}
```
`std::allocate_shared` acts like `make_shared`, except its first argument is an allocator to be used for the underlying dynamic memory allocation.

Compare the version using `make_xxx` and using raw pointer ctor:
```cpp
auto upw1(std::make_unique<Widget>());      // with make func

std::unique_ptr<Widget> upw2(new Widget);   // without make func


auto spw1(std::make_shared<Widget>());      // with make func

std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw2(new Widget);   // without make func
```
`make_xxx` version does not repeat the type `Widget`, whose duplication should be avoided.

Another concern is exception safety.
Consider this code where we process widget with a priority (ignore the suspicious looking pass `shared_ptr` by value for now):
```cpp
void processWidget(std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw, int priority);

int computePriority();

// call site
processWidget(std::shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget),  // potential
              computePriority());                   // resource
                                                    // leak!
```

This has potential resource leak. Why?
Three things need to happen here, `new Widget`, `shared_ptr` ctor, `computePriority()` call.
Compiler is allowed to generate code that put `computePriority` call in between.
Thus if `computePriority` call throws, heap allocation of Widget is done, but the memory won't be managed by a smart pointer.
`std::make_shared` avoids such a problem.
```cpp
processWidget(std::make_shared<Widget>(),   // no potential
              computePriority());           // resource leak
// even though either one of make_shared and computePriority
// can be called first in the compiler generated code 
```

`std::make_shared` also improves efficiency.
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw(new Widget);
// two memory allocations of Widget object and its control block
auto spw = std::make_shared<Widget>();
// one memory allocation to hold both the object and the control block.
```

There are circumstances where `make_shared` and `make_unique` cannot be used.
First is when deleter is passed in as argument.
Second is this: `make_unique` and `make_shared` perfectly forwards to the object's ctor, but do they forwward using parentheses or brackets?
```cpp
auto upv = std::make_unique<std::vector<int>>(10, 20);

auto spv = std::make_shared<std::vector<int>>(10, 20);
// Forwards using () or {} makes a difference for vectors!
```
They use parentheses, which means if you want to initialize the object using brackets, you can either use `new`, or pass an `std::initializer_list`:
```cpp
// create std::initializer_list
auto initList = { 10, 20 };

// create std::vector using std::initializer_list ctor
auto spv = std::make_shared<std::vector<int>>(initList);
```

For `make_shared`, there are two more caveats.
* Classes with custom `operator new` and `delete`, who typically allocates the exact size of the object in their `new`.
`std::allocate_shared` need to request size of object + size of control block, it usually doesn't work well with overloaded new.
* Big objects that has `shared_ptrs` and `weak_ptrs` pointing to it, and wants the object to be destroyed when all `shared_ptr` references are gone.
Since `make_shared` allocates the control block and the object together, and the control block is only freed after all `shared_ptr` as well as `weak_ptr` references are gone, `make_shared` created objects will not have the freedom as `new`ed objects do to deallocate the object and the control block separately.

If you have to use `new`, watch out for the exception-safety issue mentioned earlier.

You could do
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<Widget> spw(new Widget, customDel);

processWidget(spw, computePriority());     // correct, but not
                                           // optimal: pass shared_ptr by
                                           // lvalue incurs a copy thus
                                           // additional atomic opr 
// Or instead
processWidget(std::move(spw),            // both efficient and
              computePriority());        // exception safe
```

**Takeaways**
* Compared to direct use of `new`, `make` functions eliminate source code duplication, improve exception safety, and, for `std::make_shared` and `std::allocate_shared`, generate code thatâ€™s smaller and faster.
* Situations where use of `make` functions is inappropriate include the need to specify custom deleters and a desire to pass braced initializers.
* For `std::shared_ptr`s, additional situations where make functions may be ill-advised include (1) classes with custom memory management and (2) systems with memory concerns, very large objects, and `std::weak_ptr`s that outlive the corresponding `std::shared_ptr`s.


Snippet:
```cpp
// make_shared.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

// demonstrates a case where creating smart ptr from raw ptr may lead to
// exception unsafe code, while make_ functions won't have such an issue.

class Widget {
public:
  Widget() = default;
  Widget(const Widget&) = default;
  Widget(Widget&&) = default;
  Widget(int id) : d_x(id) {};

  Widget& operator=(const Widget&) = default;
  Widget& operator=(Widget&&) = default;
private:
  int d_x;
};

void processWidget(std::shared_ptr<Widget>, int priority) {}

int getPriority() {
  throw std::runtime_error("expected");
  return 0;
}

int main() {
  // exception unsafe: in compiler generated code, getPriority can get in
  // between Widget ctor and shared_ptr ctor which will cause memory leak
  try {
    processWidget(std::shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget()),
                  getPriority());
  } catch (const std::runtime_error&) {
    // swallow
  }

  // exception safe
  try {
    processWidget(std::make_shared<Widget>(),
                  getPriority());
  } catch (const std::runtime_error&) {
    // swallow
  }
  return 0;
}

```
