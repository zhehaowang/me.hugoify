# Familiarize yourself with perfect forwarding failure cases

What we mean by perfect forwarding: one function passes (forwards) its parameters to another function. (the second function should receive the first parameters that the first function receives, which rules out pass-by-value, since they are copies of what the original caller passes in)
When it comes to general purpose forwarding, we are dealing with parameters that are references.

Forwarding functions are by their nature generic, like this one with variadic templates:
```cpp
template<typename... Ts>
void fwd(Ts&&... params)             // accept any arguments
{
  f(std::forward<Ts>(params)...);    // forward them to f
}

f( expression );      // if this does one thing,
fwd( expression );    // but this does something else, fwd fails
                      // to perfectly forward expression to f
```
Several kinds of arguments can demonstrate the fwd / f discrepancy failure.

* Braced initalizers:
```cpp
// suppose we have f like this
void f(const std::vector<int>& v);

f({ 1, 2, 3 });       // fine, "{1, 2, 3}" implicitly
                      // converted to std::vector<int>
fwd({ 1, 2, 3 });     // error! doesn't compile
```
The standard dictates that compilers are forbidden from deducing a type for the expression {1, 2, 3} in the call to fwd because fwd's parameter isn't declared to be a std::initializer\_list.
Interestingly this would work
```cpp
auto il = { 1, 2, 3 };     // il's type deduced to be
                           // std::initializer_list<int>

fwd(il);                   // fine, perfect-forwards il to f
// As it2 pointed out, the difference between auto type deduction and template type deduction.
```

* 0 or NULL as null pointers would also cause type deduction to think of them as integral as opposed to pointer types.

* Declaration-only integral static const and constexpr data members
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
  static constexpr std::size_t MinVals = 28; // MinVals' declaration
  …
};
…                                            // no defn. for MinVals

std::vector<int> widgetData;
widgetData.reserve(Widget::MinVals);         // use of MinVals
```
Here compiler is Ok with a missing definition of MinVals as it does const propagation to replace occurrences of MinVals with 28, and does not allocate storage for MinVals.
If MinVal's address were to be taken, then the above code would compile but would fail at link time.
And if we have
```cpp
void f(std::size_t val);

f(Widget::MinVals);         // fine, treated as "f(28)"

fwd(Widget::MinVals);       // error! shouldn't link
```
Nothing in the code takes MinVal's address, but fwd's parameter being universal references and the compiler generated code usually treat them like pointers.
Not all compilers enforce this behavior. To make your code portable, define MinVals
```cpp
constexpr std::size_t Widget::MinVals;     // in Widget's .cpp file
```

* Overloaded function names and template names

```cpp
// suppose our f looks like the following
void f(int (*pf)(int));         // pf = "processing function"
// or
void f(int pf(int));            // declares same f as above

// and we have
int processVal(int value);
int processVal(int value, int priority);

// and we have the following
f(processVal);                  // fine
fwd(processVal);            // error! which processVal?

// same problem if we try to give the fwd function a function template
template<typename T>
T workOnVal(T param)        // template for processing values
{ … }

fwd(workOnVal);             // error! which workOnVal
                            // instantiation?

// to make this work you could manually specify the overload or instantiation
using ProcessFuncType =                        // make typedef;
  int (*)(int);                                // see Item 9

ProcessFuncType processValPtr = processVal;    // specify needed
                                               // signature for
                                               // processVal

fwd(processValPtr);                            // fine

fwd(static_cast<ProcessFuncType>(workOnVal));  // also fine
```

* Bitfields

```cpp
// Say we have the following to model IPv4 headers
struct IPv4Header {
  std::uint32_t version:4,
                IHL:4,
                DSCP:6,
                ECN:2,
                totalLength:16;
  …
};

void f(std::size_t sz);        // function to call

IPv4Header h;
…
f(h.totalLength);              // fine
fwd(h.totalLength);            // error!
```

This is because h.totalLength is a non-const bitfield, and the standard says a non-const reference shall not be bound to a bitfield.
Reason being bitfields may consist of arbitrary parts of machine words (e.g. bits 3-5 of a 32bit int), but there's no way to directly address such bits as the smallest unit you can point to is a char.

Workaround this is easy, once you find a bitfield, make a copy yourself and call fwd on the copy.
```cpp
// copy bitfield value; see Item 6 for info on init. form
auto length = static_cast<std::uint16_t>(h.totalLength);

fwd(length);                        // forward the copy
```

**Takeaways**
* Perfect forwarding fails when template type deduction fails or when it deduces the wrong type.
* The kinds of arguments that lead to perfect forwarding failure are braced initializers, null pointers expressed as 0 or NULL, declaration-only integral const static data members, template and overloaded function names, and bitfields.

Snippet:
```cpp
// perfect_forwarding_failure.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

void f(const std::vector<int>& v) {
  for (const auto& s: v) {
    std::cout << s << "\n";
  }
}

template<typename... Ts>
void fwd(Ts&&... params) {
  f(std::forward<Ts>(params)...);    // forward them to f
}

int main() {
  f({1, 2, 3});
  //fwd({1, 2, 3}); // fails to compile
  auto initializerList = {1, 2, 3};
  fwd(initializerList); // all good
  return 0;
}

```
