# Item 28: understand reference collapsing

Consider template parameter deduction for universal references again.
```cpp
template<typename T>
void func(T&& param);

Widget widgetFactory();     // function returning rvalue

Widget w;                   // a variable (an lvalue)

func(w);                    // call func with lvalue; T deduced
                            // to be Widget&

func(widgetFactory());      // call func with rvalue; T deduced
                            // to be Widget
```

Note that reference to reference is illegal in C++
```cpp
int x;
…
auto& & rx = x;   // error! can't declare reference to reference

// but with lvalue being deduced to match universal references
template<typename T>
void func(T&& param);    // as before

func(w);                 // invoke func with lvalue;
                         // T deduced as Widget&
// we would have this
void func(Widget& && param);
// yet the type of param is Widget&. How compiler handles this is called
// reference collapsing.
```

Compilers allow reference to reference not in user code but may produce them in some contexts, e.g. template instantiation.

There are four possible combinations: lvalue to lvalue, lvalue to rvalue, rvalue to lvalue, rvalue to rvalue.
If reference to reference occurs in a permitted context, compiler follows the following rule to collapse reference:

If either reference is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference. Otherwise (i.e., if both are rvalue references) the result is an rvalue reference.

Reference collapsing is a key part of what makes `std::forward` work. Whose impl can be
```cpp
template<typename T>                                // in
T&& forward(typename                                // namespace
              remove_reference<T>::type& param)     // std
{
  return static_cast<T&&>(param);
}
```

Reference collapsing can be mimicked in auto form,
```cpp
Widget w;
auto&& w1 = w;               // w1 is an lvalue reference

auto&& w2 = widgetFactory(); // w2 is an rvalue reference
```

A universal reference isn't a new kind of reference, it's actually an rvalue reference in a context where two conditions are satisfied:
* type deduction distinguishes lvalues from rvalues. Lvalues of type `T` are deduced to have type `T&`, while rvalues of type `T` yield `T` as their deducted type.
* reference collapsing occurs.
The concept of universal reference is helpful to free you from recognizing the existence of reference collapsing contexts.

Typedef and using alias declarations also employ reference collapsing.
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Widget {
public:
  typedef T&& RvalueRefToT;
  …
};

// suppose we have
Widget<int&> w;
// reference collapse makes it
typedef int& RvalueRefToT;
```

`decltype` also employs reference collapsing during its type analysis.

**Takeaways**
* Reference collapsing occurs in four contexts: template instantiation, `auto` type generation, creation and use of typedefs and alias declarations, and `decltype`.
* When compilers generate a reference to a reference in a reference collapsing context, the result becomes a single reference. If either of the original references is an lvalue reference, the result is an lvalue reference. Otherwise it's an rvalue reference.
* Universal references are rvalue references in contexts where type deduction distinguishes lvalues from rvalues and where reference collapsing occurs.


Snippet:
```cpp
// reference_collapsing.m.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <boost/type_index.hpp>

// demonstrates an implementation of std::forward and types involved during its
// instantiation with rvalues and lvalues.

// Test forward impl using 
template <typename T>
T&& my_forward(std::remove_reference_t<T>& param) {
  std::cout << "(my_forward) T is deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<T>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";
  std::cout << "(my_forward) param is deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(param)>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";
  return static_cast<T&&>(param);
}

template <typename U>
void func(U&& param) {
  std::cout << "U is deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<U>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";
  std::cout << "param deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(param)>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";

  auto&& forwarded = my_forward<decltype(param)>(param);
  std::cout << "(auto&&) forwarded is deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(forwarded)>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";

  auto auto_by_value = my_forward<decltype(param)>(param);
  std::cout << "(auto by value) forwarded is deduced to be: "
            << boost::typeindex::type_id_with_cvr<decltype(auto_by_value)>().pretty_name()
            << "\n";

  std::cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
  int x = 3;
  std::cout << "calling func with lvalue:\n";
  func(x);
  std::cout << "calling func with rvalue:\n";
  func(4);
  return 0;
}

```
